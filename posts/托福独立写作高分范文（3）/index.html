<h4 id="范文"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>在中国古人眼中，民以食为天。几千年以来，无数种菜肴的烹制方法与菜谱世代相传。享用各种各样的美食是极大的福分。有些人甚至把烹饪归为自己的爱好。然而，面对现代社会的快节奏，有人预测，20年以后人们用在做饭上的时间会变得更少。就我个人而言，我同意这个观点。</p>
<p>首先，为了迎合社会发展更高的要求，工薪阶层可能面临更紧凑的日程。其实，若想最终实现全人类共同繁荣，我们还有很长的路要走。如今，大多数人都在沉重的压力下生活和工作。处在愈演愈烈的社会竞争氛围下，每个人都会将大部分的时间和精力用在工作上。于是，他们可能无法拥有足够的休闲时间来做饭。如今很多人已经习惯了更方便的就餐方式。根据现在的趋势我们可以理所当然地判断，在不久的将来，生活节奏会越来越快。因此，用在做饭上的时间会比以往更少。</p>
<p>另外，由于更先进科技的支持，做饭程序将简易化。我们完全有理由相信在未来20年，现代科技将继续高速迅猛发展。电脑系统也许会比现在更智能得多。所有的厨房设备也许将由非常先进的微电脑控制，它们也会更加容易操作。人们将能够以很快的速度准备简单的饭菜。于是，省去了很多麻烦，做饭将变得更有效率且更容易。</p>
<p>此外，由于餐饮行业也应用了这些新科技，烹饪变得更快捷，越来越多的人也许会选择更常外出就餐。在不久的将来，这将致使餐厅数量的增加以及服务质量的改善。随着收入的提交，消费者有可能增加光顾自己心仪餐厅的次数。地点便利、多种食物可供选择以及就餐氛围舒适，这些都是一家优质餐厅的诱人特色，这也可能会使人们在家做饭的时间减少。</p>
<p>综上所述，我想说我们已经搜集到充分的证据证明这种观点：将来人们在家里做饭的时间会减少。不可否认，在厨房中烹制可口的佳肴是令人愉悦和满足之事，更不用说享受美食时的喜悦了。然而，考虑到前文提及的所有要点，在未来的20年，人们在厨房里的时间会变少，而外出就餐的次数会增多，这是可以预见的。</p>

<h4 id="范文-2"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-2"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>A controversial issue relating to the allocation of government funds has been brought to the attention of the public. <strong>Relevant</strong> authorities are urged to increase their investment on developing Internet access rather than on developing public transportation. It seems obvious to many that in this new <strong>era of information</strong> the government should be concerned with the demand for faster, cheaper and better quality Internet access. On the other hand, public transport also requires a good deal of financial support from the government. These issues need to be considered as equally important.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, financial support should be allocated to the improvement of Internet access. Nowadays the Internet has impacted far beyond any <strong>national boundaries</strong> to all corners of the globe. Of all the resulting consequences of the Internet on this society, many of them are beneficial. However, there are also influences that could be seen as negative and these are a concern for the government. Thus, more funds should <strong>be assigned to</strong> both of these two aspects of the Internet. One portion should be focused on developing the fast growing information technology so that people can have easier, cheaper and quicker access to legal websites, with <strong>a percentage of</strong> that funding being used to control and supervise the <strong>behavior</strong> of <strong>cyber companies</strong> and <strong>netizens</strong> to reduce potential harm. These may include spreading rumors, opening illegal and <strong>unsavory</strong> websites, delivering <strong>junk mail</strong>, sending <strong>viruses, hacker attacks</strong> and so forth.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, maintaining a sound public transportation system is definitely <strong>in the interest of</strong> the general public. Therefore, this also deserves attention and funding from the government. In actual fact, the continual improvements to the public transportation systems always need enormous financial support. For example, new roads have to be built and old roads must be repaired. Meanwhile, more bus routes or subways lines are being constructed and new overpasses need to be erected. In addition to the basic infrastructure, the increasing <strong>congestion</strong> and frequent traffic jams need attention and <strong>solutions</strong>. All of these projects demand a large amount of money.</p>
<p>In effect, every responsible citizen could be encouraged to join in the official efforts of developing and advancing a more <strong>harmonious society</strong>. As an example, it is advisable for people to report any illegal websites immediately and <strong>warn others against</strong> any possible threat of online frauds. Also, regarding public transport, all passengers could be more responsible. Private car owners could be more aware of reducing their car use during rush hours. These are simple ideas, but could be extremely worthwhile.</p>
<p>In conclusion, maintaining sustainable development is a common target valued in all countries today. Government officials ought to have a broader perspective <strong>when it comes to</strong> funding and avoid <strong>unilateral</strong> thinking. As a result, well-balanced investment strategies could result, ensuring steady, advanced progress of both the Internet and the public transportation systems.</p>

<p>102．政府应该将更多资金投入到互联网建设而不是公共交通建设之中吗？</p>
<p>一个有关政府资金部署的争议话题已经引起公众的关注。有人敦促有关部门将更多资金投入到互联网建设而不是公共交通建设之中。很显然，在崭新的信息时代，政府应该重视人们对更高速、更廉价以及更优质网络的需求。另一方面，公共交通也需要政府大力的资金支持。两者同等重要。</p>
<p>毫无疑问，援助资金应该用于互联网的改善。如今，互联网的影响已经远远跨越国界线蔓延至地球的每个角落。在其对社会带来的所有影响之中，多数都是有利的。然而，也存在需要引起政府关注的负面影响。因此，更多资金应该部署于以下两个方面：一部分资金用于建设高速发展的信息科技，从而使人们更轻松、更经济、更快速地浏览合法网站；而另一部分资金则用于控制和监督网络公司和网民的行为，以减少其潜在危害，这些危害包括散播谣言、开放非法污秽网站、发送垃圾邮件、传播病毒、黑客攻击等。</p>
<p>然而，维护健全的公共交通体系显然符合广大群众的利益。因此，政府也应给予关注与资金援助。其实，公共交通体系的持续改善始终离不开政府巨大的经济支持。例如，新公路需要修建，旧公路则需要维修。与此同时，更多的公交车路线或地铁路线正在建设中，新的天桥也需要架设。除了基础设施，愈发严重的交通拥挤与频发的交通堵塞也亟待关注与解决。所有这些工程都需要大量资金。</p>
<p>事实上，每一位有责任感的公民都应该与官方携手努力共建更加和谐的社会。例如，人们应该及时举报非法网站并提醒他人免受网络诈骗的威胁。同时，在公共交通方面，所有的乘客都应该更具责任感。私家车车主则应该更有意识地减少在高峰时段开车的次数。这些都是简单的办法，却是极其值得去做的。</p>
<p>总之，维系可持续发展是当今所有国家的共同目标。就资金部署而言，政府官员应该拥有更广阔的视野并避免片面思想。因此，均衡协调的投资战略是卓有成效的，它能确保互联网与公共交通体系都获得稳定且高速的发展。</p>

<h4 id="范文-3"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-3"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>Life is meant to be enjoyed instead of just being endured. However, this is not usually the case in reality. Nowadays, most working people have been forced to give up their leisure time because they only have time to do what they must do. Things we like to do are <strong>squashed</strong> under the heavy pressure of time and work. In my view, it is imperative that people keep a balance between enjoyment and responsibilities.</p>
<p>Above all, everyone is entitled to enjoy life. So long as the means to pursue pleasure are appropriate, no one ought to be deprived of a happy and relaxing time. This is especially important in today’s stressful daily environment. Due to the fast pace of living in society, the majority of people have very limited time to thoroughly relax and entertain themselves, <strong>let alone</strong> a completely enjoyable lifestyle. Even during the weekend, much work has to be done and so the busy pace continues nonstop at home. With an increasing number of young adults being <strong>diagnosed</strong> with ill health, it is critical that they rest and get refreshed. Watching funny movies, going to the park, having a delicious meal at the restaurant, or even taking a long journey to appreciate the beauty of nature, are all effective and suitable ways to <strong>recuperate</strong>. They deserve enough time for enjoyment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there is no excuse to ignore what we should do. One must undertake one’s responsibilities. As social beings, each person is playing a number of roles. For instance, at home, they could be parents who have the responsibility of taking care of their children and showing them how to be healthy in body, mind and spirit. No matter how difficult this seems to be, they should never give it up. At work, a person could be a <strong>team leader</strong> who has to be responsible for developing key strategies, making major project plans as well as managing their team members. Such duties need to be handled conscientiously and <strong>with diplomacy</strong>. Neglecting one’s duties might lead to unfavorable consequences. Therefore, shouldering responsibilities is essential.</p>
<p>In fact, what is really needed is a sustainable balance between both enjoyment and responsibilities. Perhaps people’s schedules could be <strong>overhauled</strong>! Using <strong>time-management skills</strong>, people will be able to create <strong>pockets of</strong> <strong>time</strong> to enjoy doing what they like, and also schedule into their week the important things they absolutely must do. Considerate bosses and team leaders could also have a more <strong>humane</strong> attitude. Then the possibility that people will like what they should do can become a reality. Life is then made more enjoyable than ever.</p>
<p>To sum up, it is an exaggeration to say that people spend too much time on enjoyment and an objective attitude would be useful regarding this issue. The current social realities have determined that people must fulfill their <strong>obligations</strong>, but leisure and enjoyment are important too. As long as there is a good balance between the two, one is able to live a meaningful and satisfactory life.</p>

<p>103．我们只做我们喜欢做的而不做应该做的吗？</p>
<p>生活理应是被享受的，而不是被忍受的。然而，在现实中情况往往并非如此。如今，大多数劳动者已经被迫放弃了自己的休闲时光，因为他们只有时间去做必须要做的事。而我们喜欢做的事在有限的时间和繁重的工作压力之下遭到了挤压。在我看来，人们应该保持享乐与职责之间的平衡。</p>
<p>首先，每个人都有权享受生活。只要享乐的方法恰当，谁都不应该被剥夺享受轻松快乐时光的权利。这在当今充满压力的日常环境中显得尤为重要。由于社会生活的快节奏，大多数人只有很有限的时间彻底放松和娱乐，更不必说拥有完全享乐型的生活方式了。即便在周末还是会有很多事情要做，于是，不停歇的快节奏在家里仍然持续着。由于越来越多的青年人健康状况不佳，他们务必得好好休息以恢复精神。观看有趣的电影、逛公园、在餐厅享用美食，甚至长途跋涉去欣赏大自然之美，所有这些都是恢复精神的有效且合适的途径。他们理应拥有充足的享乐时光。</p>
<p>与此同时，我们应该做的事也是不容忽视的。一个人必须承担他／她应有的责任。作为社会成员，每个人都扮演着各种角色。例如，在家里，他们可能是要负责照顾孩子并使其身心健康的父母。无论这个责任有多么艰巨，他们永远也不应放弃。在工作中，一个人可能是团队领导者，他／她负责制定核心策略、做出重点项目计划以及管理团队成员。承担这些职责时需要一丝不苟的精神和技巧，而玩忽职守可能导致不良后果。因此，肩负责任是至关重要的。</p>
<p>其实，真正需要的是维持享乐与承担责任之间的平衡。或许人们的日程表可以被彻底修改！通过使用时间管理技巧，人们能够留出足够的时间做自己喜欢做的事，同时也能在每周日程表中加入必须要做的重要事情。贴心的老板和团队领导者也可以抱有更人性化的态度。那样，“人们喜欢做自己应该做的事”的梦想就会成为现实了。于是，生活就会变得比以往更快乐。</p>
<p>总之，不能夸张地认为人们将太多时间用于享乐。对于这个问题，应该持有客观的态度。如今的社会现实决定了人们必须履行相应的义务，然而休闲与享乐也很重要。只要两者之间保持平衡，人们就可以过上有意义且称心如意的生活。</p>

<h4 id="范文-4"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-4"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>How can we judge if a student will be able to succeed? This question has been frequently raised by teachers and parents <strong>alike</strong> and many different answers have been given. There are numerous factors that make a person successful. Some of these qualities can be traced back to his <strong>consistent behavior</strong>. In this regard, some say that students who can keep their rooms organized are more likely to succeed. In my view, I think such a judgment could be reasonable.</p>
<p>In the first place, the ability to organize is one of the key qualities that successful people possess. If a student manages to keep his room clean, tidy and organized, it indicates that he might just have the essential organizing skills needed to succeed. Just as a famous Chinese saying goes, “if a person cannot <strong>sweep</strong> his house, how can he conquer the world?” Indeed, the ability to organize even a small room well is a valuable skill. Such ability is found in many successful figures, especially those <strong>world-renowned business leaders</strong>. Most of them have excellent managing capabilities that can keep a massive company well-organized. Steve Jobs, the late former CEO of Apple Co. Ltd, could <strong>be referred to as</strong> an outstanding example whose organizing ability is <strong>unparalleled</strong>.</p>
<p>In the second place, a student who keeps his room well-organized may be extremely accomplished in dealing with details. This trait is important for a person who looks forward to great future achievements. In many people’s eyes, engaging in <strong>household chores</strong> is an undesirable <strong>imposition</strong>. Indeed, there are many small details to <strong>attend</strong> <strong>to</strong>, like placing books in the bookshelf, cleaning the floor, <strong>dusting</strong> the tables and chairs, <strong>rearranging</strong> items in the <strong>closet</strong>, and <strong>making the bed</strong>. All these tasks must be done to make a room orderly. Actually, being conscientious is a quality that many successful scientists have. Without this capability, Thomas Edison may never have made so many great inventions. His willingness to attend to small details, to overcome troubles and failures, as well as those numerous experiments all paved the way for his brilliant success. Human history is full of similar examples for us to learn from.</p>
<p>Last but not least, perseverance is another character usually found in a student who keeps his room wellorganized. Admittedly, it is easy to arrange a room well for several days, but to keep up this good habit for a long time is an ability that takes determination. It requires one to be <strong>persistent</strong>. The way to success is a long one, <strong>beset</strong> <strong>with</strong> obstacles. Without the powerful spirit of perseverance, a person could <strong>in no way</strong> reach their success.</p>
<p>To conclude, those who have the potential for success often <strong>exhibit</strong> superior qualities in their daily lives. In the eyes of an <strong>on-looker</strong>, such details might go <strong>unnoticed</strong> at first, but on closer <strong>inspection</strong> many clues present themselves in a student’s daily habits. <strong>One indication is that</strong> if they are well-organized, the chances of having other excellent qualities that ensure success are high.</p>

<p>104．将自己的房间整理得井然有序的学生更有可能成功吗？</p>
<p>我们如何判断一个学生是否能够成功呢？这个问题常被老师和家长们一并提起，答案也不尽相同。促使一个人成功的因素有很多，在这些品质中有的也许与他／她的一贯行为相关。鉴于此，有人认为将自己房间整理得井然有序的学生更可能成功。在我看来，这种判断是合理的。</p>
<p>第一，组织能力是成功者具备的重要品质之一。如果一个学生能将自己的房间保持得干净、整洁且井然有序的话，这表明他／她可能拥有成功所需的最基本的组织技能。中国有句名言：“一屋不扫，何以扫天下？”的确，将即使很小的房间整理得井然有序也是一种宝贵的技能。很多成功人士都具备这种能力，尤其是那些世界著名的企业家。他们大多拥有优秀的组织管理能力，这种能力可以使一家大公司有条不紊地运行。已逝的苹果公司前首席执行官史蒂夫·乔布斯就被认为是具有超凡组织才能的杰出典范。</p>
<p>第二，将自己的房间整理得井然有序的学生可能极其善于处理细节问题。这个特质对于渴望取得伟大成就的人来说很重要。在很多人眼中，做家务是一件苦差事。的确需要顾及很多琐事，如排列书架上的书籍、清洁地板、清除桌椅上的灰尘、重新整理壁橱里的物品以及铺床。只有完成了所有这些任务才能使房间整洁有序。其实，认真谨慎是很多成功科学家具备的品质。若没有这种能力，托马斯·爱迪生也许就不能完成那么多伟大的发明。他对待琐碎细节的谨慎态度、克服困难和失败的意志以及那无数次试验都为他的辉煌成功铺平了道路。人类历史中有很多类似的事例值得我们学习。</p>
<p>最后，坚持不懈是善于整理房间的学生通常所具备的另一个品质。不可否认，仅仅连续几天把房间整理好是很容易做到的，然而，将这个好习惯长久持续下去却必须下定决心。这需要持之以恒。通向成功的道路是漫长且充满艰难险阻的。一个人若没有坚持不懈的强大精神力量是无法成功的。</p>
<p>总之，有成功潜力的人通常在日常生活中展现出其优异的品质。在旁观者眼中，这些细节也许刚开始很不起眼，然而通过仔细观察便可从学生的日常习惯中探寻到很多线索，其中之一就是：如果他们拥有很好的组织能力，那么他们拥有其他确保成功的优秀品质的几率也会很高。</p>

<h4 id="范文-5"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-5"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>Playing sports benefits people tremendously. Not only does <strong>joining in</strong> such physical activities help one relax the mind and keep healthy, but it also <strong>trains his character</strong> as well. Nowadays, a huge number of youngsters are enthusiastically taking part in various sports activities. Some <strong>adults</strong> insist that children should only play sports for fun rather than <strong>competition</strong>. As far as I am concerned, this is an extreme viewpoint.</p>
<p>To begin with, most children play sports because it is fun. On the campus playground or in the <strong>courtyard</strong>, children’s <strong>laughter</strong> can be heard every now and then when they are playing sports. Evidently, they enjoy these moments! This is their <strong>temporary break</strong> from the pressure of schoolwork when they <strong>get to</strong> participate in their favorite activities. No matter what kind of games they are, whether football, basketball, tennis, or some other sport, they <strong>adore</strong> running around and feeling as free as birds. Perhaps this is just where the creative nature of children finds an expression. According to the statistics, 7 out of 10 school-age youngsters prefer to play sports in their leisure time. This shows us how powerfully appealing sports are to children.</p>
<p>I think that having an opportunity to participate in a sporting contest may be beneficial to children. As a matter of fact, in order to become a well-balanced person, one has to cultivate strong <strong>willpower</strong> and the ability to compete and cooperate at an early age. Taking part in competitive sporting events is an effective method of achieving this aim. In most primary schools, sports meetings are being held every semester. This indicates that contests really benefit children in many ways. For instance, during the relay race, students gradually realize the strong power of unity and teamwork. At the <strong>starting line</strong>, each competitor is fully prepared to pass the <strong>baton</strong>. As soon as the <strong>signal</strong> rings, they <strong>do their utmost to</strong> run to reach their target. The determination to win could be traced in each team member and it binds their hearts together. <strong>Regardless of</strong> the final result, everyone has succeeded in gaining the experience of teamwork and of contributing their effort.</p>
<p>Moreover, competitive sport also helps children discover more of their natural talents and some find they have the potential to become <strong>professional players</strong> in the future. A person’s <strong>gift</strong> for a particular sport might show up in early childhood. An outstanding performance during a match or contest is likely to <strong>attract the attention of</strong> a <strong>coach</strong>. Thus, he may be fortunate enough to be selected as a member of a professional team that competes in major sporting events. In reality, many world-famous <strong>gold medalists</strong> in the Olympic Games were first discovered this way.</p>
<p>All in all, I think children should be encouraged to join in various sporting events. In their efforts to meet the challenges that sport and teamwork provide, they can train themselves both spiritually and physically and their potential as an excellent player could be discovered in the process. Thus, there is no need to prohibit children from playing sports in contests.</p>

<p>105．孩子们参加体育活动应该仅仅以玩耍为目的而不应以比赛为目的吗？</p>
<p>体育极大地造福于人类。参加体育活动不仅帮助人放松心情、保持健康，而且还能磨练性格。如今，很多青少年都在积极地参加各种体育活动。而有的大人则坚持认为体育活动对于孩子们来说仅仅是为了玩耍要而非为了比赛。在我看来，此观点过于极端。</p>
<p>首先，大多数孩子是为了玩耍而参加体育运动的。在校园操场上或院子里，随时可以听到孩子们运动时发出的阵阵笑声。不言而喻，他们喜欢这些运动时光！当他们参与自己钟爱的运动时便可以暂时摆脱功课的压力。无论是足球、篮球还是网球，或其他体育项目，他们喜欢如同小鸟一般自由自在地来回奔跑。这也许就是孩子天性的诠释。统计显示，有70％的学龄青少年喜欢在课余时间进行体育运动。这表明了体育对孩子们强大的吸引力。</p>
<p>我认为，获得参加体育竞赛的机会对孩子是有益的。其实，为了全面发展，必须在很小的时候就培养坚强的意志和与他人竞争、合作的能力。参加竞争激烈的体育比赛就是达到这个目标的有效方法之一。在大多数小学里，每学期都会召开运动会。这表明比赛在多方面都对孩子们真的有益。例如，在接力赛中，学生会逐渐意识到团结与协作的强大力量。在起跑线处，每位选手都为传递交接棒作充分准备。信号一响起，他们就会拼尽全力飞快冲向终点。取胜的决心存在于每一位队员的心中，并将他们的心紧紧连结起来。无论最后结果如何，每个人都成功获得了团队协作与奋力拼搏的经验。</p>
<p>此外，竞技体育还帮助学生挖掘自己更多的天赋，有的学生会发觉自己有在未来成为职业运动员的潜质。一个人在某特殊体育项目上所具有的天份也许在童年初期就显现出来了。学生在比赛中的出色表现可能会引起教练的注意。于是，他们就可能有幸被选拔为备战重大体育赛事的专业运动队队员。实际上，很多世界闻名的奥运会金牌获得者都是这样被最先发现的。</p>
<p>总之，我认为应该鼓励孩子们参加各种体育比赛。在努力迎接比赛与团队协作给予的挑战过程中，他们的身心都得到了锻炼。同时，在这个过程中他们成为优秀运动员的潜力也可被挖掘。因此，没有必要禁止孩子们参加体育比赛。</p>

<h4 id="范文-6"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-6"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>People who boast a large number of friends are always admired by others. Friendship fills our life with joy and is one of the most enjoyable privileges human beings are endowed with. Each individual may have his unique criteria for choosing friends. Some believe that friends should <strong>have much in common with</strong> each other. In their opinion, people who are interested in different subjects and activities cannot become friends. <strong>Frankly speaking</strong>, I disagree with such an idea.</p>
<p>First, there is no denying that people with the similar interests find it easier to become friends. To quote a well-known proverb, “<strong>birds of a feather flock together</strong>.” One of the major elements that sustain excellent human relations lies in extensive communication between people. In most cases, having a similar interest provides a good topic for discussion. As the two are familiar with it, an in-depth talk is more than likely. During the course of exchanging ideas, much can be gained and mutual understanding will be strengthened as well. In a sense, it paves the way for establishing stable friendships. Therefore, with the purpose of making friends, many people prefer to join various interest groups and clubs. It is in such places that the closest friends might be made. I <strong>encountered</strong> my best friend Melinda when we participated in an activity organized by the <strong>poetry</strong> club in my university. Due to our common passion for <strong>ancient poems</strong>, we always had much to share and finally became intimate friends.</p>
<p>However, difference is not a barrier to friendship. Indeed, no one should <strong>reject</strong> another person merely because they have different interests. As long as there is <strong>sincerity</strong>, <strong>affection</strong> and mutual trust existing between two people, by no means will their friendship be hindered. On the contrary, many people are willing to <strong>tolerate</strong> differences and even some <strong>shortcomings</strong> of their cherished friends. Our daily lives are full of such examples. One of my colleagues is a passionate <strong>badminton</strong> fan. As an outsider, I used to <strong>show no interest in</strong> it. Yet our different interest never affected my friendship with him. His kindness and generosity convinced me that he could be a valuable friend. Now we are very good friends.</p>
<p>Furthermore, having a friend with different interests makes life more interesting and colorful. In fact, efforts could be made to let the other person become familiar with those interests and perhaps persuade him to accept them. Thus, he will have a fresh new interest of his own. It could certainly add joy to his life. As a matter of fact, the ability to adapt to different ideas is also desirable in a world which values <strong>diversity</strong>.</p>
<p>To summarize, friendship is established on the basis of various elements. Everyone is entitled to select their friends according to their own standards. In my opinion, it is <strong>thoughtless</strong> to say that being interested in different things would make friendship impossible. On the contrary, accepting differences may sometimes strengthen ties between people and help them become real friends in the end.</p>

<p>106．兴趣不同的人很难成为朋友吗？</p>
<p>拥有很多朋友的人总是受到他人的羡慕。友谊使我们的生活充满快乐，也是上苍赐予人类最令人愉快的恩赐之一。每个人择友标准不尽相同。有些人认为朋友彼此间应该有很多共同点。在他们看来，对不同的话题或活动感兴趣的人无法成为朋友。坦率地讲，我不同意这种观点。</p>
<p>首先，不可否认，拥有相同兴趣的人更容易成为朋友。有句耳熟能详的俗语说得好，“物以类聚，人以群分。”维持良好人际关系的要素之一就是人们之间广泛的交流。在大多数情况下，拥有相同的兴趣为讨论提供了一个很好的话题。由于双方都对话题很熟悉，他们更有可能展开深入探讨。在交换想法的过程中会有很多的收获，相互了解也会加强。在某种意义上，这为建立牢固的友谊铺平了道路。因此，为了交朋识友，很多人都愿意加入各种兴趣小组或俱乐部。正是在此类场所才能结识最贴心的朋友。我就是这样遇到我最好的朋友梅林达的，当时我们都参加了大学诗歌俱乐部举办的一次活动。由于对古诗的共同喜好，我们总是有很多可以彼此分享的东西，于是，我们最终成为了密友。</p>
<p>然而，差异并不是友谊的障碍。的确，没有人会仅仅因为兴趣不同而将他人拒之门外。只要彼此间怀着真诚、情感以及相互信任，他们的友谊就是无法阻隔的。相反，很多人都愿意接纳自己珍惜的朋友的不同点乃至缺点。我们日常生活中就有无数这样的例子。我的一位同事是热情的羽毛球爱好者。作为外行的我曾经对此毫无兴趣。然而不同的兴趣从未影响到我们彼此间的友谊。他的善良与慷慨使我确信他可以成为值得珍惜的朋友。现在，我们已经是非常要好的朋友了。</p>
<p>此外，拥有一个兴趣不同的朋友还会使生活更有趣味且丰富多彩。其实，可努力让对方熟悉自己的兴趣，并尽可能说服他／她接受。这样，他／她就有一个崭新的兴趣了。这必定会为他／她的生活增添欢乐。实际上，对不同想法的适应能力在当今珍视多样性的世界也是很需要的。</p>
<p>总之，友谊建立在多种元素的基础之上。每个人都有权根据自己的标准择友。在我看来，认为兴趣互异的人们无法成为朋友是欠考虑的。相反，接受这些差异有时会巩固人们之间的关系，并且帮助他们最终成为真正的朋友。</p>

<h4 id="范文-7"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-7"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>In a team, unity is one of the most <strong>highly-valued commodities</strong>, with all members <strong>moving toward</strong> the same goal. Without their combined efforts, there is no way they could achieve that goal. Of course it is inevitable that each individual will have his own perspective and <strong>points of view</strong>. Differences of opinion should not hinder the progress of the team, but benefit group with fresh ideas. Thus, it is possible that people with different views can succeed as a team.</p>
<p>Firstly, differences may spark debates and in-depth discussions that <strong>give birth to</strong> better ideas. It is well known that debating on controversial issues is a <strong>frequently-adopted</strong> means to <strong>provoke</strong> creative thinking. The same is true within a team. Psychologically speaking, with the objective of convincing the others of their valuable ideas, people holding different views may do their utmost to <strong>pick out</strong> the <strong>weak points</strong> of their team <strong>mates’</strong> ideas. This helps everyone to become clearer about those ideas. As for the flaws that are revealed, they can always be improved upon. In this regard, different views may <strong>be complementary to</strong> each other. By removing the weaknesses and assimilating the strengths, all members of the team are likely to gain more constructive and useful viewpoints. This trend would certainly do more good than harm for improving the effectiveness of a team.</p>
<p>In a strong team where members are pursuing the same objective, different viewpoints will not necessarily have a negative effect. The prerequisite for any successful team is the <strong>unshakable</strong> goal that is shared by all. Thus, different views are unlikely to threaten the harmony and power of the entire team. In a sense, through the discussions and debates, people are provided with opportunities to get to know each other better. Thus, mutual understanding will be strengthened during those exchanges. It is also possible that stable friendships may also be established on this basis. Ample evidence can be seen in real life. I was once involved in a project that aimed at improving teaching methods. Some of my colleagues <strong>disagreed with</strong> my views, yet we managed to decide on a satisfactory plan through frequent discussions and even became good friends during the process.</p>
<p>Admittedly, all team members should do their best to avoid <strong>hostility</strong> because of different opinions. Immersed in a <strong>heated</strong> debating atmosphere, some <strong>sensitive</strong> individuals might <strong>lose their temper and speak ill of</strong> others rudely. This inevitably undermines the existing harmony within the group. Therefore, it is the responsibility of every member to be fully aware of this while discussing controversial topics. Mental unity is one of the most desirable qualities of an efficient team.</p>
<p>In brief, as long as individual differences can be accepted and utilized, a team will not be negatively affected and teamwork has a promising future. Meanwhile, some open-minded team leaders might even try to encourage their members to express diversified thoughts freely. Thereafter, we may conclude that people with different views can make up a successful team.</p>

<p>107．持有不同观点的人组成的团队无法取得成功吗？</p>
<p>在一个团队中，团结是其拥有的最珍贵的品质之一，所有成员向着共同的目标前进。若没有共同努力，他们是无法达到这个目标的。当然，每个人难免会有自己的见解和观点。观点相异并不会阻碍整个团队的进步，反而会为团队注入新鲜的想法。因此，拥有不同观点的人组成的团队是可能取得成功的。</p>
<p>首先，不同的观点可以激起辩论和深入探讨，从而产生更好的想法。众所周知，围绕争议话题进行的辩论是启发创造性思维的惯用方法。在团队协作中也同样。从心理角度而言，为了使他人对自己的珍贵见解信服，持有不同观点的人会尽全力挑拣对方的弱点。这有助于每个人更清楚那些观点。对于揭露出来的缺陷，它们总是可以得到改进。鉴于此，各异的观点也许是彼此互补的。通过消除缺点并吸收长处，所有的团队成员都可能获得更有建设性且更有用的观点，此趋势对提高团队效率必定是利大于弊的。</p>
<p>在一个强大的团队中，成员们追求着相同的目标，而相异的观点并不一定会产生负面影响。造就成功团队的前提条件就是所有人拥有共同的坚定目标。因此，不同的观点不可能威胁整个团队的和谐与实力。在某种意义上，通过讨论和辩论，人们获得了增进相互了解的机会。因此，在这个交换意见的过程中，相互间的理解得到了巩固。牢固的友谊也有可能在此基础上建立起来。现实生活中有很多这样的例子。我曾参与过一个旨在改善教学方法的项目。当时有些同事不同意我的观点，然而，在经过了屡次讨论之后，我们最终制定出了理想的计划，甚至在此过程中还成为了好朋友。</p>
<p>必须承认的是，所有的成员都应该尽力避免不同意见引发的敌对情绪。沉浸在热烈的辩论氛围时，有些敏感的人也许很可能发脾气并粗鲁地说他人坏话。这难免会损害团队内现有的和谐。因此，在讨论争议性话题的时候，每个成员都有责任充分意识到这一点。精神团结是一个高效团队最理想的品质之一。</p>
<p>简言之，只要个人的不同意见得到接受与应用，团队就不会遭受其消极影响，而且也会有光明的前途。同时，有些思想开明的团队领导甚至还会鼓励成员自由地表达各种想法。因此，我们可以得出这样的结论：拥有不同观点的人能够组成一个成功的团队。</p>

<h4 id="范文-8"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-8"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>Real-life experience has taught us that plans are easy to make, yet extremely difficult to <strong>follow through with</strong>. In our daily lives, there are probably a number of plans that have not been <strong>carried out</strong> effectively. Thus, regarding plans for the future, some people tend to make them practical, for fear that challenging plans cannot be fulfilled. However, I believe it is better to make challenging plans for one’s future.</p>
<p>Firstly, challenging plans motivate people to be more ambitious in <strong>attaining</strong> their goals. <strong>Napoleon</strong> used to say, “<strong>Every French soldier carries a marshal’s baton in his knapsack</strong>.” Indeed, he who does not have great ambitions can never succeed. High spirits and a <strong>burning</strong> desire to reach higher goals should be a prerequisite for those who dream of a brilliant future. To some extent, sketching out challenging plans demonstrates a person’s powerful ambitions and <strong>iron-willed</strong> determination. After all, “where there’s a will, there’s a way!” So long as enthusiasm does not diminish, the chance of conquering each challenge in the plan will be remarkably enhanced. Like a <strong>compelling</strong> source of power, these plans offer the impetus to keep people consistently <strong>moving ahead</strong>.</p>
<p>In my opinion, challenging plans can accelerate self-improvement, because in order to complete those formidable tasks a person will have no other choice but to make progress continuously. Thus, a higher standard is adopted and <strong>inspired</strong> effort is made. As a matter of fact, there are a number of ways to achieve faster selfimprovement. These include attaining extensive knowledge on various topics, choosing diverse activities and social events to accumulate rich experience and to consult with <strong>the wise</strong> to learn what one can from them. In the process of fulfilling one’s challenging plans, mistakes and temporary failures will most likely be encountered. This helps a person to recognize their shortcomings, so that immediate action can be taken to rectify them.</p>
<p>However, we should try to avoid making plans that are too <strong>unrealistic</strong> to be achieved. Sometimes people fill their goals with <strong>fancy dreams</strong>. Far from reality, these dreams are impossible to realize and such plans towards their fulfillment are destined to be futile. In most of these cases, people <strong>lose heart</strong> and become frustrated with the disappointing outcomes and then their mental health suffers.</p>
<p>Therefore, all these points should be thoroughly taken into consideration when planning for the future. Without a doubt, in one’s endeavors toward success, a million challenges will be encountered. The best way is to face them bravely and overcome them one by one. Thus, it is better to set higher standards for ourselves by making challenging plans, because this will help us to strive towards our goals with added enthusiasm and <strong>boundless</strong> <strong>energy</strong>.</p>

<p>108．选择挑战性的计划还是实际的计划？</p>
<p>现实生活的经验教导我们，计划很容易制定，但彻底执行起来却极其艰难。在日常生活中，我们可能会有很多还未得到有效执行的计划。因此，由于害怕自己不能完成有挑战性的计划，有些人偏向为未来制定较为实际的计划。然而我认为，未来计划具有挑战性更好。</p>
<p>首先，挑战性的计划促使人们为实现自己的目标变得更加雄心勃勃。拿破仑曾经说过：“不想当将军的士兵不是好士兵。”的确，没有雄心壮志的人是不能成功的。高昂的士气和到达更高目标的热切渴望对梦想拥有辉煌未来的人来说是必须满足的前提条件。在某种程度上，制定有挑战性的计划展示出一个人勃勃的雄心和坚定的决心。毕竟，“有志者事竟成。”只要热情还未消退，攻克计划中每个挑战的几率就会显著增加。如同无穷的力量之源，这些计划给予人们持续前进的动力。</p>
<p>在我看来，挑战性的计划能加速自我完善，这是因为，要想完成这些艰巨的任务，除了不断进步之外别无他法。于是，人们就会确定更高的标准，做出更大的努力。实际上，有很多可以实现更快自我完善的方法，包括汲取各领域广泛的知识、参加各种活动或集会以积累丰富的经验、以及请教智者并尽自己所能向他们学习。在履行挑战性计划的过程中，很可能会遭遇错误与暂时的失败。这有助于一个人认清自己的缺点，从而立即采取行动改正这些不足。</p>
<p>然而，我们应该尽力避免制定出无法完成的不切实际的计划。有时候，人们的目标充满了幻想。由于远离现实，这些幻想是无法实现的，而这些计划的完成也注定会落空。在大多数情况下，人们会对令人失望的结果感到灰心丧气并一蹶不振，随后，心理健康就会遭受威胁。</p>
<p>因此，在制定未来计划时，需要进行彻底周全的考虑。毫无疑问，在向成功拼搏的过程中会出现无数次挑战。最佳方法就是勇敢地面对，并将它们逐一征服。因此，应该通过制定挑战性计划为自己确定更高的标准，因为这有助于我们以更大的热情与无穷的力量向目标奋进。</p>

<h4 id="范文-9"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-9"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>Among the <strong>countless</strong> problems in our everyday lives, many are too complicated to be handled alone. Indeed, nobody can do without the help from others, especially under difficult conditions. Family members are often the most reliable people we can <strong>turn to</strong>, but it is also the responsibility of the government to help its citizens and this kind of support can sometimes bring about better results. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary for the government to assist us in times of need.</p>
<p>To begin with, some problems can be better solved with the help of the government. For instance, when a child is missing, the best solution is to report it immediately to the police. Then a <strong>full-scale search</strong> can be carried out. If a child has been <strong>kidnapped</strong>, the police are the most qualified to save that child from danger. When serious pollution has been caused by a nearby factory and threatens the residents’ health, it is also <strong>advisable</strong> to turn to the government for help. In this way, immediate measures can be taken to stop the factory from releasing more pollutants. When a consumer has purchased a product and finds that it is <strong>inferior</strong>, he can seek <strong>legal assistance</strong> from the government. In this way, his losses might be <strong>reimbursed</strong> and his basic rights better protected. Evidently, the government is in the best position to help people solve such important problems.</p>
<p>As <strong>public servants</strong>, officials should do their best to help ordinary citizens when they are in trouble. In the past, Chairman Mao used to inspire the Chinese government to serve the people heart and soul. Such an inspiration ought to be <strong>passed down</strong> from generation to generation. Doubtlessly, the gap existing between the authorities and the common citizens needs to be narrowed. One of the major reasons why some individuals are reluctant to seek help from the government lies in that gap. People have formed the impression that the officials are too busy to <strong>care</strong> <strong>about</strong> their <strong>private matters</strong> and such an <strong>assessment</strong> needs to be changed.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, social responsibilities are mutual. With an aim to maintain social harmony and progress, the government and its people should join hands. That is to say, every citizen ought to be dedicated wholeheartedly to the work of building social harmony. Powerful spiritual support should also be rendered to the government and to <strong>reciprocate</strong>, the government needs to help its people whenever complicated problems arise.</p>
<p><strong>By and large</strong>, we should all bear in mind that important problems can be better solved through the combined efforts of the ordinary people together with the government. Evidently, every individual deserves the right to receive official assistance. On the part of the authorities, they should do their best to let people know that they are <strong>more than willing to</strong> help. Only in this way can a society prosper and experience harmony.</p>

<p>109．政府没有必要帮助那些可以自救的人吗？</p>
<p>在我们日常生活里遭遇的无数难题之中，有很多过于复杂，自己是无法独立解决的。的确，每个人都离不开他人的帮助，尤其是处于困境时。家人通常是我们最可靠的求助之源，然而政府也有责任帮助其公民，且政府的帮助有时会产生更好的结果。因此，政府绝对有必要在我们需要的时刻给予帮助。</p>
<p>首先，在政府的帮助下，有些问题可以得到更好的解决。例如，当一个孩子失踪的时候，最好的办法就是立刻报警。警方随即会展开全方位的搜索。如果孩子遭到了绑架，警察是最有能力将其从危险中解救的人。当附近一家工厂导致了严重的污染，并威胁到了居民的健康，也应该向政府求助。这样，就会有即刻的措施出台来防止工厂释放出更多污染物。当一位消费者买到了伪劣产品，他／她可以寻求政府的法律援助。这样，他／她的损失也许可以得到补偿，其基本权利也得到了更好的保障。很显然，对于以上这些重要问题，政府是最佳的求助对象。</p>
<p>作为社会公仆，官员理应尽全力帮助有困难的群众。在过去，毛主席曾经鼓励中国政府全心全意为人民服务。这种鼓舞应该得到世世代代的继承和发扬。毋庸置疑，存在于政府当局与普通民众之间的鸿沟需要缩小。有些人不愿意向政府寻求帮助的主要原因之一就源自此鸿沟。人们已经形成了这样的印象：政府官员总是太忙了，根本无暇顾及他们的私事。这种评判需要做出改变。</p>
<p>实际上，社会责任是相互的。为了维持社会和谐与进步，政府与人民应该携起手来。也就是说，每一位公民都应该为建设社会和谐的工作全心奉献，同时还应给予政府强大的精神支持。作为回报，每当复杂难题出现时，政府需要向群众伸出援助之手。</p>
<p>总而言之，我们应该牢记一点，那就是，通过普通百姓和政府机关的共同努力，重要问题便可得到更好的解决。的确，每个人都拥有接受官方援助的权利。而对于政府当局来说，他们应该尽量使群众明白他们心甘情愿给予帮助。只有这样，社会才能繁荣发展，人们才能和谐共处。</p>

<h4 id="范文-10"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-10"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>At school, most students must have been taught not to judge by appearances. Undeniably, outward looks can never be the only criterion on which to evaluate a person. Any unilateral assessment might <strong>lead to</strong> faulty results. Nonetheless, owing to the enhancement of individual <strong>taste</strong>, people are paying more attention to fashion nowadays. Therefore, the way one is dressed in might be an indication of his or her character, although it can never be the best indicator.</p>
<p>First of all, one’s dressing styles reveal his or her individual preferences, which are closely associated with the personality. For example, if a person often selects <strong>casual</strong> clothing in his or her daily life, including T-shirts, blue jeans and <strong>sportswear</strong>, he or she might enjoy a relaxing way of living and might also be interested in physical activities. Thus, there is the possibility that this person may be open-minded and easy-going. By contrast, if one usually wears formal clothes like suits, he or she might be <strong>businesslike</strong> and <strong>treat</strong> matters very seriously. Additionally, if a person prefers very bright or eye-catching colors, he or she might be very outgoing. On the other hand, if one often chooses darker colors, he or she might be <strong>timid</strong> or prefer a <strong>lower profile</strong>.</p>
<p>Secondly, from one’s way of dress some clues of his or her character can also be traced. On different occasions, people are supposed to dress themselves suitably. To illustrate, at dancing parties <strong>evening dress</strong> could be a best choice. When an important conference is being held, everyone present should dress formally. If a person frequently <strong>fails to</strong> wear suitable clothes on special occasions, he or she might be very careless in dealing with daily matters. In addition, if a person always wears out-dated and <strong>poorly-matched</strong> clothing, he or she might be backward in personal taste. On the contrary, if a person always succeeds in attracting other’s attention and dresses fashionably, he or she might be smart and <strong>adaptable</strong> to changes.</p>
<p>In addition to dressing habits, behavior and manners are more reliable means to know a person’s real character. Just as an old Chinese saying goes, “A distant journey tests the strength of a horse and a long task proves the character of a man.” Thus, instead of focusing mainly on a person’s outward appearances, we should attach greater importance to his or her daily behavior. Through <strong>long-term contacts</strong>, this person’s <strong>inner traits</strong> will be further discovered.</p>
<p>In brief, a person’s dressing styles give the signs of his or her preferences and <strong>individuality</strong>. From the clothes this person chooses to wear under different circumstances, we may also gain some information about his or her personality. In spite of this, it is unwise to rely totally on <strong>superficial</strong> judgments. One’s character can be best known from how he behaves.</p>

<p>110．一个人的着装风格是其性格或个性的体现吗？</p>
<p>在学校里，大部分学生一定都学到“勿以貌取人”这个道理。不可否认，外表不能作为评价一个人的唯一标准。任何片面的衡量都可能导致错误的结果。然而，由于个人品位的提升，人们如今越来越注重时尚了。因此，一个人的着装风格可能是其性格的一种体现，虽然这不可能是最佳的体现。</p>
<p>首先，一个人的着装风格揭露了他／她的个人偏好，这与其个性联系紧密。例如，如果一个人在日常生活中常选择休闲类服装，包括T恤、牛仔裤和运动服等，那么他／她也许喜欢轻松的生活方式，或者也对体育运动感兴趣。因此，这个人有可能很开朗、很随和。相比之下，如果一个人经常穿西服之类的正式服装，那么他／她也许讲求效率且做事非常认真。另外，如果一个人偏爱鲜亮耀眼的颜色，他／她也许非常爽直奔放。相反，如果一个人经常选择深色调，他／她也许很腼腆或很低调。</p>
<p>其次，从一个人的着装方式可以探寻到他／她性格的某些线索。在不同的场合，人们应该穿着恰当。例如，在舞会上，晚礼服为最佳之选。而在举行重要会议时，出席人员应该穿着正式。如果一个人总是在特殊场合着装不当的话，那么他／她可能在处理日常事务的过程中非常粗心大意。此外，如果一个人总是穿过时的或者搭配俗气的衣服，他／她也许缺乏个人品位。相反，如果一个人总能成功地吸引他人的注意，并且穿着时尚，那么他／她就可能很精明，并且对变化的适应能力很强。</p>
<p>除了着装习惯，行为和举止是了解一个人真实性格的更可靠的方法。中国有句古话，“路遥知马力，日久见人心。”因此，我们应该更注重其日常行为而不是将焦点主要集中在外表上。通过长期接触，这个人的内在品质就会进一步显现。</p>
<p>简言之，一个人的着装风格透露了他／她的偏好和个性方面的信息。从他／她在不同场合选择的衣着，我们也可以获得有关其性格的某些信息。尽管如此，完全依靠表面的判断是不可取的。一个人的性格只有通过其所作所为才能彻底被他人了解。</p>

<h4 id="范文-11"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-11"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>An innovative proposal has been put forward lately concerning a critical choice every high school student faces. Some people suggest that they should spend a year traveling or working before going to university. Admittedly, this idea <strong>posts a challenge to</strong> the traditional <strong>routine</strong> of school education which is supposed to be carried on without <strong>periodical suspension</strong>. However, according to my perspective, this new attempt might be reasonable.</p>
<p>Above all, one year’s social experience will help students make a clearer plan about their future career. Due to the lack of real-life experience, it is difficult for students to know which job best fits them after graduation. Only by experiencing practical work can they obtain better <strong>knowledge about themselves</strong>. For instance, during the course of working, they might <strong>gradually</strong> discover whether they are really interested in <strong>performing such tasks</strong> and whether they are confident enough to do it well in the future. Meanwhile, it is also a good chance to test their personal skills and abilities. They may understand the importance of putting what has been learned into practice. These all enable them to select the most suitable major in college. What’s more, their learning efficiency at college might also be enhanced, because they have <strong>profoundly</strong> comprehended how theories and practical uses relate to each other.</p>
<p>Besides, traveling also benefits <strong>teenage</strong> students in many aspects. During their high school years, <strong>seldom</strong> have they been offered the time and freedom to go on a long journey alone. At the moment when they finally finish their preliminary education, instead of <strong>continuing with</strong> their <strong>pressed</strong> days on campus, students should spend a longer period of time <strong>opening their eyes</strong> and seeing more of the world. Traveling could be a best way to help teenagers <strong>broaden their vision</strong> and witness more diversified images in different places around the globe. In those cases, not only will they become more knowledgeable, they can also take advantage of the traveling experience to train their <strong>life skills</strong>. Thus, they are likely to become more independent and mature at the time they finally return home and enter university.</p>
<p>In fact, the whole society and the government should strive to establish safer and more <strong>agreeable conditions</strong> for teenagers to complete a one-year social life <strong>with ease</strong>. On the part of enterprises, they ought to supply more job positions that specially fit high school graduates so that they can handle given duties more effectively. In the meantime, the government should also try to <strong>cut down</strong> the traveling expenditures of these students by implementing a series of <strong>preferential policies</strong>. These may include lower transportation costs, better traveling services and cheaper hotel rooms specially <strong>reserved</strong> for students.</p>
<p>To conclude, the progress of society demands favorable renovations in major areas, among which school education deserves more focused attention. Indeed, some weak points exist in the traditional education <strong>practices</strong> which will urge authorities and educators to try new methods. <strong>From a certain angle</strong>, it may be beneficial to let students work or travel for a year before attending college.</p>

<p>111．在上大学之前，学生应该用一年时间旅行或工作吗？</p>
<p>最近有一项创新议案出台，议案与每个高中生都面临的关键选择有关。有些人提议，学生在上大学之前应该花一年时间旅行或工作。不能否认，这个想法对无中止周期的传统学校教育模式提出了挑战。然而，依我所见，这个新尝试也许是合理的。</p>
<p>首先，一年的社会经验会帮助学生制定出更清晰的未来事业计划。由于缺乏现实经验，学生很难在毕业后知道自己最适合哪种工作。只有通过实际工作经验才能获得更好的自我认知。例如，在工作过程中，他们可能逐渐发现自己是否对履行此类职责真得感兴趣以及是否在未来有胜任这份工作的自信。与此同时，这还是检验个人技能的良机。他们会懂得将所学知识应用于实践的重要性。所有这些使他们能够选择最适合自己的大学专业。此外，他们上大学时的学习效率也可能会提高，因为他们已经深刻领悟到理论与实践如何联系在一起的。</p>
<p>另外，旅行也在很多方面对青少年学生有益。在中学时代，他们很少有时间和自由独自进行长途旅行。当他们最终完成了初级阶段的教育时，学生应该花较长一段时间看看外面的世界，而不是继续过压力繁重的校园生活。旅行就是青少年开阔视野、见证全球不同地区多姿多彩景象的最佳途径之一。那样的话，他们不仅会变得更有学问，而且可以利用旅行的经历训练自己的生存技能。因此，他们就有可能在最终回到家然后走进大学的时候变得更加独立且更加成熟了。</p>
<p>其实，为了使青少年轻松完成这个为期一年的社会生活计划，全社会和政府应该努力为他们创造更安全、更舒适的条件。对于企业来说，他们应该提供更多的特别适合中学毕业生的工作机会，以便他们更有效地完成被分配的任务。与此同时，政府还应该通过实施一系列优惠政策试图削减这些学生的出行开支，这包括更低廉的交通费、更优质的旅行服务以及为学生特别预留的经济客房。</p>
<p>总之，社会进步要求在主要领域内进行合理的改革，其中，学校教育值得更多关注。的确，传统教育实践中存在一些弱点，这促使政府和教育工作者尝试新的办法。从某个角度来看，让学生在上大学之前工作或旅行一年也许是有好处的。</p>

<h4 id="范文-12"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-12"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>If a person <strong>manages to</strong> tackle difficulties by taking advantage of his own knowledge, this is <strong>by all means</strong> a fulfilling experience. Solving problems independently justifies his ability and makes him more confident. However, in real life it is inevitable to encounter problems that cannot be <strong>conquered</strong> alone. Under such situations, consulting others for advice is an effective way to find the solutions <strong>in time</strong>.</p>
<p>In the first place, people should be encouraged to use personal knowledge as often as possible. As is generally known, the best way to master knowledge is to use it. If what has been learned is only <strong>stored</strong> in the mind without being utilized, then it might <strong>rust</strong> the brain. What’s worse, the knowledge itself might even be forgotten or <strong>deserted</strong>. As soon as a problem <strong>shows up</strong>, it is time to make full use of stored knowledge. During the struggle toward the final solution, old knowledge becomes alive and refreshed. Meanwhile its essences are better comprehended and <strong>commanded</strong>. Therefore, even if this attempt to conquer a challenge fails in the end, it is still worthwhile, for the experience has further improved one’s personal knowledge and helped him become more capable. He may also <strong>be</strong> <strong>better prepared for</strong> future problems.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the process of solving problems resembles that of learning. More new methods, techniques and knowledge can be gained, especially when asking others for advice. On such occasions, <strong>advisors</strong> are simply playing the role of teachers who offer enlightening guidance. By no means could a student achieve success without the instructions of his teachers. It is also true while combating a complicated problem. Examples are everywhere to be found in our daily life. I once encountered a <strong>technical</strong> problem with my <strong>laptop</strong>. Due to the complex <strong>operation</strong> <strong>sequence</strong>, it was beyond my own ability to use a type of software tool correctly and effectively. Fortunately my neighbor, a computer engineer in an <strong>IT company</strong>, was happy to help. After <strong>following his advice</strong> I finally became <strong>skillful at</strong> operating it.</p>
<p>Besides, there is no need to <strong>hesitate</strong> before seeking suggestions from other people. Just as Confucius used to say, “<strong>Feel not ashamed to learn from one’s subordinates</strong>.” Without doubt, <strong>modesty</strong> makes one go forward, whereas <strong>conceit</strong> makes one <strong>lag behind</strong>. If a person is too proud to consult others, then he might be on the verge of failures. Only by holding a modest attitude can possible failures be better prevented.</p>
<p>In sum, to become a fully capable individual, one must appreciate the fact that advice received from others is equally important. Although the quality of being independent is valued in the modern world, one should never give up any opportunity to learn from others. Thus, whenever a problem appears and cannot be solved with personal knowledge, the best choice is to consult other people modestly.</p>

<p>112．运用自己的知识和经验还是询问他人的建议来解决问题？</p>
<p>如果一个人利用自己的知识成功地克服了困难，那么这无论如何都是一次令人满意的经历。独立解决问题证实了个人能力，并且使人更加自信。然而，在现实生活中人们难免遭遇无法独立解决的问题。在这种情况下，向他人寻求建议就是及时找到答案的一种有效途径。</p>
<p>首先，应该鼓励人们尽可能经常应用个人知识。众所周知，掌握知识的最佳方法就是应用知识。如果学到的东西仅仅储存于脑中而无法应用，那么大脑就会生锈。更糟糕的是，就连知识本身也可能会被遗忘或荒废。只要问题一出现，充分利用储备知识的时刻就到来了。在努力探寻最终解决方法的过程中，陈旧的知识又重新活跃起来。与此同时，其精髓会得到更好的理解和把握。因此，即便克服挑战的尝试以失败告终，这也是值得的，因为这段经历已经更进一步提高了一个人的知识水平，使其更有能力，而且也可以使其为将来的困难作更好的准备。</p>
<p>其实，解决问题的过程与学习相似。更多新方法、新技巧和新知识可以收于囊中，尤其是在请教他人的时候。在这种情况下，提供意见者简直扮演着给予启发性指导的教师角色。若没有教师的指导，学生是无法取得成功的，在攻克复杂问题的时候也是如此。在日常生活中此类事例举不胜举。我曾经遇到了一个有关笔记本电脑的技术难题。由于某软件工具的复杂操作程序，我无法正确并有效地使用它。幸运的是，我的邻居是一名IT公司的电脑工程师，他很乐意给予帮助。在遵循了他的建议之后，我最终可以熟练地操作此软件了。</p>
<p>此外，在向他人寻求建议之前不必犹豫。正如孔子所云，“不耻下问”。毫无疑问，虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后。如果一个人因过于自负而不愿意请教别人的话，他／她也许就处在失败的边缘。只有秉承谦虚的态度才有可能更好地防止失败。</p>
<p>总而言之，为了成为有能力的人才，人们必须明白一个道理，那就是，来自他人的意见同等重要。尽管独立的品质在现代世界备受推崇，但也不应该放弃任何向他人学习的机会。因此，每当问题出现且不能用个人知识解决的时候，最佳的选择就是谦逊地向他人请教。</p>

<h4 id="范文-13"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-13"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>We may often hear some people <strong>complain about</strong> their children’s problems. Indeed, regardless of the times, generation gaps still exist. Judging from current trends, the barrier between parents and children has become even thicker. Compared to their counterparts five decades ago, parents today truly <strong>have more difficulty in</strong> understanding their children.</p>
<p>To begin with, the <strong>complexity</strong> and diversity in the modern world may be a major contributor to such a problem. The third wave in this new era has led to an <strong>information explosion</strong>. Under its overwhelming impacts, no child can stay completely <strong>untouched</strong>. Ever since the first day they were allowed to sit before the computer screen, they have begun to endure the wave power of the Internet. <strong>As time goes by</strong>, access to diversified and complicated online sources will inevitably affect their innocent minds. It is also beyond the parents’ ability to bring them totally under control. As a result, more and more teenagers are becoming mature rapidly and earlier. The way they behave and think <strong>differs</strong> tremendously <strong>from</strong> the children 50 years ago. That just constitutes one of the key reasons why parents today find it harder to understand their children thoroughly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the faster pace of life leaves very limited time for parents to communicate with their children. The unmatched competitiveness in society nowadays has urged most workers to turn themselves into busy bees. Seldom do they have enough leisure time. The situation is even tougher for working parents. They have to devote <strong>a large portion of</strong> time to their work, both in the office and at home. The torturing pressure is sure to make them <strong>frustrated</strong> physically and spiritually. How could they have enough energy and <strong>patience</strong> to have in-depth talks with their children every day? Thus, as time goes on a <strong>mental border</strong> between them might gradually show up, hindering good mutual understanding.</p>
<p>By contrast, the minds of children used to be simpler half a century ago. Looking back on the old days, most ordinary families were leading a <strong>plain</strong> life, either in the city or in the village. As a matter of fact, the real nature of children lies in innocence. A lowered-paced and less complicated social environment is the most agreeable condition that helps maintain the <strong>purity</strong> and simplicity of children’s mental world. Thus, parents could understand their children more easily in the past. In addition, they were also able to spend more time together with their children. The chances of <strong>heart-to-heart</strong> communications were much higher.</p>
<p>On the whole, the widened gap between parents and children nowadays is caused by a number of factors, some of which are closely related to negative impacts from social advancement. Factually, mutual understanding is the foundation of all good human relations. Thus, in order to <strong>narrow</strong> the gap, parents ought to focus more efforts on good communications with their children.</p>

<p>113．当今的父母不如<strong><strong>50</strong></strong>年前的父母理解自己的孩子？</p>
<p>我们也许经常听到一些人抱怨自己孩子的问题。的确，无论时代如何变迁，代沟依旧存在。从当前趋势判断，父母和孩子之间的隔阂加深了。比起半个世纪之前的父母，当今的父母的确更不易理解他们的孩子了。</p>
<p>首先，现代世界的复杂性和多样性也许是导致此问题的一个主要因素。新时代的第三次浪潮带来了信息大爆炸。在其巨大的冲击之下，孩子无法完全免遭波及。自从被允许坐在电脑屏幕前的第一天起，他们就开始承受互联网的超强威力了。随着时间的流逝，各种复杂的网络资源难免会影响他们幼稚的心灵。父母也很难彻底控制这种局面。于是，越来越多的青少年更快地早熟。他们的行为与思维方式与50年前的孩子大相径庭。这恰恰是当今的父母为何更难彻底理解自己孩子的主要原因之一。</p>
<p>此外，更快的生活节奏使父母与子女的沟通时间变得非常有限。当今社会无比激烈的竞争促使大多数劳动者使自己忙碌不堪。他们很少有足够的休闲时间。对于工作中的父母来说状况更为不妙。他们必须花大部分时间在办公室或在家里劳作。超负荷的压力必定使他们身心受挫。他们又怎么会有充足的精力和耐心每天都与孩子展开深入交谈呢？于是，随着时间的推移，父母与孩子之间的心理隔阂可能会逐渐产生，并阻碍彼此之间良好的理解。</p>
<p>相比之下，半个世纪之前孩子的心灵更加淳朴。回顾过去，无论在城市还是在乡村，大多数普通家庭都过着简朴的生活。其实，天真无邪是孩子的天性。慢节奏与简单的社会环境最有利于保持孩子内心世界的简单纯洁。因此，过去的家长更容易理解自己的孩子。此外，他们也有更多时间与孩子在一起，从而增加了彼此进行坦诚沟通的机会。</p>
<p>总体而言，当今的父母与孩子之间变宽的鸿沟是由一系列因素引起的，其中有些与社会进步带来的负面影响密切相关。实际上，相互理解是所有良好人际关系的基础。因此，为了拉近彼此间的距离，父母应该尽更大努力与孩子进行良好的沟通。</p>

<h4 id="范文-14"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-14"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>The diligence of scientists always deserves our <strong>awe and respect</strong>. Many of their achievements have brought about great changes to society, especially those that can be fully adopted in everyday life. Each year, an increasing number of research projects are <strong>being financed by</strong> the government. Admittedly, some of these research efforts may have no practical use. Some people argue that the government should not support such projects. In my opinion, however impractical they are, they still need official assistance.</p>
<p>First and foremost, scientific research is conducted for varied purposes. The field of science can <strong>be divided</strong> <strong>into</strong> different branches and research could be focused on any of them. Going through the history of science, we may marvel at the long list of scientific research done for numerous purposes. Indeed, not all of them are closely related to daily life. In addition to practical uses, other aims should never be neglected; they are of equal significance. But for them, the sustainable development of science can never be maintained. For instance, there are millions of mysteries in the <strong>universe</strong>. In order to <strong>probe into</strong> them, much research work has to be completed. Regardless the <strong>practicality</strong> of the outcomes, people are <strong>granted</strong> better knowledge about the universe. This is a meaningful way to make human beings less <strong>ignorant</strong>. Even though such concepts and knowledge may not be <strong>put</strong> <strong>into use</strong> in real life, they are indispensable to human society.</p>
<p>Secondly, although some research cannot be put into practice at present, it might pave the way for future achievements that could serve practical uses. During the course of experiments, research methods might be <strong>renovated</strong>. Thus, they could be adopted in future projects that would then <strong>yield</strong> more efficient operation. Indeed, all research projects are <strong>dependent on</strong> each other. The concepts or theories in <strong>one set of</strong> research may be equally useful in another. Thus, all the efforts of conducting a single research project shall not have been made without avail, but rather they may become a stepping stone that leads scientists to greater accomplishments in days to come.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the government should also attach importance to reducing the <strong>side effects</strong> of all scientific research. Undeniably, some research achievements have <strong>incurred</strong> potential hazards after they have been widely used. To illustrate, if there were some chemical elements discovered during a research project, they could be adopted in medicine. However, if people <strong>are exposed to</strong> them, their health may be undermined. Thus, before the research results are finally put into practical use, thorough consideration and a <strong>sound oversight system</strong> should be maintained by the government.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, in the field of science, some research may not be carried out merely for practical purposes. As long as there is far-reaching significance encompassed within such research, the government should provide support to it. After all, scientific studies <strong>are destined to serve the common interest of</strong> the entire human race.</p>

<p>114．政府应该支持那些无任何实际用途的科学研究吗？</p>
<p>科学家的勤奋总会赢得我们的敬畏与尊重。很多科学成就给社会带来了巨变，尤其是那些可以被充分应用于日常生活中的成就。每年，越来越多的研究项目得到政府的资助。不可否认，有些研究成就也许无法应用于实践。一些人认为政府不应该支持此类项目。在我看来，无论它们是否实用，都仍然需要官方援助。</p>
<p>首先，科学研究是基于各种目的的。科学领域可划分为不同的分支，研究也可能以任何分支为中心展开。纵观科学史，我们也许会对为各种目的而做的科学研究的超长名录清单感到惊叹。的确，并非所有的项目都与日常生活密切相关。除了实际用途，其他目的也不容忽视，它们同等重要。如果没有这些成果，科学的可持续发展就无法维系。例如，宇宙中蕴藏着无数奥秘。为了深入探索，很多研究工作需要完成。无论探索结果是否具有实用性，人们都获得了对宇宙的更进一步认识。这是使人类不再那么愚昧的一种有意义的方式。尽管相关理念与知识可能无法应用于现实生活，它们都对人类社会起着不可替代的作用。</p>
<p>第二，尽管有些研究目前无法应用于实际，也许它们为未来具有实用意义的成就铺平了道路。在试验的过程中，研究方法会得到革新。那么，这些方法便可应用于将来更富成果的研究项目里。的确，所有的科研项目都彼此相依。一系列研究中的概念或理论在其他研究中也同样有用。因此，进行某单一研究项目所付出的所有努力不会是徒劳的，相反，它们会成为指引科学家走向未来更大成就的基石。</p>
<p>与此同时，政府还应对减少所有科研项目的负面影响给予重视。不可否认，有些研究成果在广泛应用于实际之后引发了潜在的威胁。具体来讲，如果一些化学元素在科研项目中被发现，它们可能会被应用于医学领域。然而，倘若人类接触到这些元素的话，他们的健康将受到损害。因此，在研究结果最终应用于实践以前，政府需要进行谨慎周全的考虑，并建立起健全的监管体系。</p>
<p>总之，在科学领域，有些研究可能不仅仅是专为实际目的开展的。只要此类研究富含深远的意义，政府就应该给予支持。毕竟，科学研究注定是为全人类的共同利益服务的。</p>

<h4 id="范文-15"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-15"></a> 范文</h4>
<p><strong>Subscribing to</strong> newspapers and magazines seems to be a habitual action of many people. Being the most reliable sources of information, these traditional media forms <strong>keep</strong> readers <strong>updated about</strong> the latest happenings around the globe. Needless to say, they could be good ways to learn about a different nation. However, they are no longer the best way. Due to the <strong>striking</strong> power of <strong>web-based</strong> technology, more <strong>alternatives</strong> are available in the modern world.</p>
<p>Undeniably, the broad coverage of news reports and <strong>commentary</strong> helps people learn much about any country. To illustrate, stories printed in newspapers and magazines are typically associated with almost every major aspect of a nation, including political events, society, business, sports, entertainment and <strong>public figures</strong>. Besides, editorial pages are often <strong>attached</strong>, which normally includes <strong>columns</strong> for the editors or the writer’s opinions, the criticism and debates of critics, or even readers’ letters. Such content provides further analysis of current events and enables readers to obtain more profound knowledge about the country. Therefore, in order to know about current situations in a foreign country, one convenient way is to browse through its major newspapers or magazines. For instance, reading articles in* The Washington Post, The New York Times or Time *Magazine helps foreign readers <strong>form a</strong> <strong>clearer picture about</strong> the United States. Additionally, there are also some types of <strong>publications</strong> that specifically <strong>cater to</strong> international readers. Printed in many different languages and <strong>distributed</strong> around the world, these sources may focus more on topics that interest people from overseas. Among the best examples are <em>China Daily</em> and <em>Beijing Review</em> could be <em>mentioned</em>.</p>
<p>However, with the prevalence of new mediums, <strong>paper-based</strong> newspapers and magazines are gradually losing subscribers. In effect, their strongest competitor is the Internet. Enormous sources of information can be found online with ease, which allows the masses to learn about a different country far more efficiently and <strong>economically</strong>. Combined with challenges from other traditional media like TV and radio, modern readers are becoming less enthusiastic about buying newspapers or magazines every day. We cannot deny their limitations: the lack of sound and visual effects prevent paper media forms from vividly communicating their stories. The process of publishing is also complicated, involving <strong>drafting</strong>, collecting, <strong>proofreading,</strong> printing, distributing, etc. Thus, possible delays might be <strong>induced.</strong></p>
<p>Actually, there are many other ways to learn about a foreign country. A good command of knowledge can never do without diversified useful methods. Therefore, it is better to make full use of every opportunity <strong>at hand</strong>. After all, “Rome was not built in a day.” Any field of knowledge needs to be accumulated through <strong>multiple</strong> channels and by various means. Knowing about a country is no exception. As a matter of fact, visiting museums, traveling, reading books about different cultures and values, and seeing movies are all favorable choices that further people’s understanding about other nations.</p>
<p>In sum, in a world led by globalization it has become more important for people to learn about other countries. Reading newspapers and magazines is an effective and familiar way. At the same time, we should also make full use of other useful sources to <strong>meet that end</strong>. Without doubt, the most profound and comprehensive knowledge ought to be gained through various channels.</p>

<p>115．报纸和杂志是了解外国的最佳途径吗？</p>
<p>似乎很多人都养成了订阅报纸杂志的习惯。作为最可靠的信息来源，这些传统的媒介形式帮助读者掌握全球最新的动态。不必说，它们是了解外国的好方法。然而，它们不再是最佳途径了。由于网络技术的强大冲击力，现代世界里的人们拥有了更多的渠道。</p>
<p>不可否认，新闻报道及评论的广泛性有助于人们了解众多有关任何国家的信息。例如，报纸和杂志上刊登的文章涉及一个国家里几乎所有的主要领域，包括政治事件、社会、商业、体育、娱乐以及公众人物。此外，它们还常常附有社论专页，通常涵盖编辑或作者评论专栏、批评家述评与辩论，甚至是读者来信。这些内容为时事提供深入分析，并使读者获得有关一个国家更深刻的知识。因此，若想了解外国的当前形势，一个便捷的途径就是浏览其主要报纸或杂志。例如，阅读《华盛顿邮报》、《纽约时报》或《时代杂志》都能帮助国外读者更清晰地认识美国。此外，还有一些专为迎合国际读者需求编辑的出版物，它们用多种不同的语言印刷，并在全球范围内发行。这些资源也许更能吸引海外人士的兴趣。《中国日报》和《北京周报》就是其中的典范。</p>
<p>然而，随着新媒介的普及，纸质的报纸杂志订阅量逐渐减少了。其实，它们最强大的对手就是互联网。人们可以在网上轻松搜索到海量信息资源，这有助于大众更有效、更经济地了解不同的国家。再加上其他传统媒介带来的挑战，如电视和广播，现代读者对每天购买报纸杂志渐渐失去了热情。我们不能否认它们的劣势，例如，由于缺乏声音和视觉效果，纸质媒介无法生动地叙述事件。出版的过程也是繁琐的，涉及撰稿、整理、校对、印刷、发行等。因此，信息可能遭到延误。</p>
<p>其实，也有很多了解外国的其他途径。对知识的精通离不开多种有用的方法。因此，最好充分利用任何手边可利用的机会。毕竟，“罗马非一日所造。”每个领域的知识都需要借助多重渠道且通过各种方式积累。了解一个国家也是如此。实际上，参观博物馆、旅游、阅读有关不同文化价值的书籍以及看电影都是使人们进一步了解其他国家的理想之选。</p>
<p>总之，在全球化趋势引领下的世界里，人们越来越有必要了解其他国家了。阅读报纸杂志是一个有效且熟悉的方法。与此同时，我们还应充分利用其他有用资源以达到此目的。毫无疑问，最深刻、最全面的知识需要通过各种渠道获取。</p>

<h4 id="范文-16"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-16"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>The sports field is a <strong>cradle</strong> that cultivates numerous <strong>shining stars</strong>, most of whom are professional athletes. The unparalleled popularity of sports events among the masses has led the sporting industry to huge profits. Players <strong>competing for</strong> professional teams or clubs are also receiving ample pay. Some people can’t help wondering if they really deserve such high salaries. As far as I am concerned, they do deserve what they get.</p>
<p>First, they have to make great sacrifices during long-term training. I suppose some outsiders only see the happiness shown on their faces at the moment of victory. Nevertheless, it is difficult for them to <strong>visualize</strong> the formidable pains they have <strong>endured</strong> while preparing for each event. As we all know, childhood is the most critical period in life to cultivate a gifted athlete. Most professional players have possibly begun participating in sports teams at very early ages. Once they start their sports endeavors, intensive and hard-pressed training is <strong>unavoidable</strong>. Compared with other children, they have far less time to study and play. Indeed, any ambitious athlete has to be a <strong>persistent trainer</strong> who is devoted wholeheartedly to practice. Consequently, a large portion of their golden youth might be consumed at <strong>training sites</strong> and on <strong>match fields</strong>. What’s worse, the possibility of getting injured is also high under such <strong>harsh</strong> conditions. That explains why there is always news about the injuries of famous sports stars.</p>
<p>Second, the career life of most professional athletes is shorter compared with other fields. Without doubt, the most primary requirement in sports activities lies in strong physical conditions. Age is a decisive factor affecting the functions of the human body. No matter how skillful a player may be in <strong>applying techniques</strong>, he has to surrender to such a reality. Before they even get old, they may find they no longer meet the high physical demands of sports events. Thus, most players <strong>retire</strong> at a young age. Even though some excellent athletes are fortunate enough to be selected as coaches, many of them have to leave the sports field and take up completely new careers. This is another huge sacrifice to make. With this regard, professional athletes truly deserve better pay due to their early retirement.</p>
<p>Last but not least, some of them may also <strong>bring glory to</strong> the nation by competing in international events. The best-known “<strong>Dream Teams</strong>” constitute shining examples. In important world-wide competitions, such a title symbolizes the superior power to win a gold medal. Among the outstanding members that make up “Dream Teams,” most are professional athletes playing for famous sports clubs or associations. <strong>Michael Jordon</strong>, the worldrenowned NBA player, used to represent his country to defeat other basketball teams in the Olympic Games. Many other sports stars are doing the same. Their contributions to their nations should be greatly rewarded.</p>
<p>In conclusion, owing to the unique features of professional sports, those who are diligently engaged in this cause ought to be paid on a higher standard. As for the enthusiastic fans, they are also most willing to pay for the expensive tickets to watch their favorite athletes playing <strong>live</strong>. Thus, there is enough evidence to justify my point that they definitely deserve high salaries.</p>

<p>116．职业运动员理应得到高薪吗？</p>
<p>体育界是培养无数耀眼明星的摇篮，而大部分明星都是职业运动员。体育比赛在大众中难以匹敌的热度为体育行业带来了丰厚的利润。效力于职业队或俱乐部的运动员也同时享受丰厚的待遇。有些人禁不住质疑他们是否应该领取如此高额的工资。在我看来，这些都是他们应得的报酬。</p>
<p>第一，在长期的训练过程中他们不得不作出巨大的牺牲。想必有些旁观者仅仅看到了他们在胜利时刻挂在脸上的喜悦，然而却很难想象他们在备战每场比赛时所承受的巨大痛苦。众所周知，童年时期是培养天赋运动员最关键的阶段。大多数职业运动员也许在很小的时候就开始参加体育队了。体育生涯一旦开始，高强度、高压力的训练便在所难免了。比起其他同龄的孩子，他们拥有更少的时间学习与玩耍。的确，任何雄心勃勃的运动员必须持之以恒地训练，并全心全力地投入。于是，他们黄金般的青春大部分都花费在了训练场或赛场之上。更糟糕的是，在如此艰苦的条件下受伤概率也很高。这就解释了为什么我们总会看到有关著名体育明星受伤的新闻报道。</p>
<p>第二，大多数职业运动员的职业生涯比其他行业人士的职业生涯更短。毋庸置疑，体育运动最基本的要求就是强壮的体魄。年龄是影响人体功能的一个决定性因素。无论一位运动员在运用技巧方面有多么娴熟，都不得不在年龄的现实面前妥协。在还未真正变老之前，他们就发现自己已无法达到体育比赛的体能高标准了。于是，大部分运动员在年轻的时候就退役了。尽管有些优秀的运动员有幸被选为教练，但很多人都得离开运动场并开始全新的职业生涯。这是他们需要作出的另一巨大牺牲。鉴于此，早年退役的职业运动员理应得到更好的工资待遇。</p>
<p>最后，有些运动员通过参加国际赛事为国家争光。名震四海的“梦之队”就是最光彩的榜样。在重大国际比赛中，这个头衔象征着赢得金牌的雄厚实力。在组成“梦之队”的优秀队员中，大部分都是为著名体育俱乐部或体育联盟效力的职业运动员。闻名世界的NBA球员迈克尔·乔丹就曾经代表他的国家参加奥运会并战胜了其他国家的篮球队。很多体育明星都是如此。出于他们对国家的贡献，获得丰厚报酬也理所应当。</p>
<p>总而言之，由于体育行业与众不同的特征，那些辛勤从事这项事业的人理应获得更高的酬劳。对于热诚的体育迷来说，他们也心甘情愿花重金买票观看自己钟爱的运动员的现场比赛。因此，我们有充足理由相信，职业运动员的确应该获得高工资。</p>

<h4 id="范文-17"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-17"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>Nowadays, it has been a popular trend among modern citizens to move out of their hometowns. These changes of <strong>residence</strong> will inevitably incur several problems and much time is needed to <strong>get accustomed to</strong> a fresh environment. Thus, some people are <strong>ideologically</strong> against such a tendency, complaining that it will cause one to lose old friends. From my view, in spite of such <strong>detractors</strong> the merits of moving to a new place far exceed its defects.</p>
<p>First of all, more friends can be made in new surroundings. An old saying teaches us the truth that “<strong>there</strong> <strong>are always more fish in the sea</strong>.” Moving to a different place grants one a new <strong>neighborhood</strong> in which to <strong>reside</strong> and a new working environment in which to work. Either in daily life or at work, a new circle of friends will soon be created and maintained. Thus, it should be considered a <strong>blessed</strong> privilege to gain the opportunity to establish friendships with more people. In other words, good friends are everywhere to be found. For any open-minded individual, the process of gaining more friends <strong>equates to</strong> that of <strong>making a</strong> bigger <strong>fortune</strong>. Indeed, there is no absolute stranger in the world. <strong>Bathing</strong> in a same atmosphere, mutual understanding might be initiated at any moment. Co-workers, neighbors and other people in the community are all likely to become good friends. Thus, instead of losing friends, <strong>migration</strong> paves the way for gaining new ones.</p>
<p>In fact, old friends can still be kept in spite of longer distance. It is a smaller world we are now living in. Communications between people are faster and more convenient than ever. In addition to the traditional methods like making phone calls and sending letters or postcards <strong>by mail</strong>, new technology has <strong>brought forth</strong> many efficient channels that can help strengthen friendships <strong>across distance</strong>. For instance, numerous <strong>online instant</strong> <strong>communication tools</strong> have been developed. Among them, the most popular ones include MSN, QQ, Skype, Google Talk, and more. <strong>Faraway</strong> friends can be reached <strong>handily</strong> at any time. They can even see each other through <strong>video chatting</strong>. In addition, with more advanced transportation networks around the globe, old friends can get together in person conveniently. Just buying an airline ticket can make an old friend show up before one’s eyes. Anyway, as long as their hearts are tightly bound, never can distance hinder the stable friendship between people who <strong>live apart</strong>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, other benefits can be gained from migrating to a new place. Undoubtedly, every city or country boasts its unique cultures and customs. Living in fresh surroundings can enrich a person’s life experience and <strong>enlarge</strong> his knowledge scope. Meanwhile, better job opportunities may be available if the new place is more developed. In that case, the <strong>living standard</strong> and education quality might be enhanced as well. Besides, one’s adaptability to changes is considerably improved owing to changes in living environment.</p>
<p>Consequently, there is no need to worry about losing old friends after moving to a new place. Real and stable friendship should be strong enough to endure the test of space and time. Meanwhile, we ought not to <strong>neglect</strong> some potential advantages when people are immersed in a different living atmosphere. Thus, ample evidence is available to justify a choice to move away from a hometown.</p>

<p>117．搬到另一座城市或另一个国家居住的利与弊</p>
<p>如今，背井离乡去异地生活已成为现代人追赶的一种潮流。居住地的改变难免会引发若干问题，而且人们还需要花很多时间适应新环境。于是，有的人在思想上排斥这种趋势，并抱怨这会使他们失去老朋友。在我看来，尽管如此，搬至异地的优点远远超过其缺点。</p>
<p>首先，在新环境里可以结交更多的朋友。一句古老的格言教导我们，“天涯何处无芳草。”搬至异地给予人们崭新的居住社区和工作环境。无论是在日常生活还是在工作中，新的朋友圈可以很快建立并维持下去。因此，拥有与更多人建立友谊的机会是荣幸的。换句话说，好朋友处处可寻。对于开朗的人来说，获得更多朋友的过程就好比赢得一笔更大的财富。的确，四海之内皆兄弟。若处在共同的氛围中，相互了解便一触即发。同事、邻居以及社区内的其他人都可能成为好朋友。很显然，移居为收获新朋友铺平了道路，而并非失去朋友。</p>
<p>其实，尽管相隔甚远，老朋友之间的友谊依旧长存。我们生活的世界变得越来越小。人们之间的沟通比从前更加快捷方便了。除了诸如打电话、邮寄信件或明信片之类的传统方法，新科技也为巩固异地友谊之路开通了多种有效渠道。例如，人们已经开发出无数种网上即时通讯工具，其中最受欢迎的包括MSN、QQ、Skype、Google Talk等。人们可以在任何时候方便地与远方的朋友取得联系。他们甚至可以通过视频聊天看到对方。此外，由于更发达的全球交通网络，老朋友可以很方便地聚会。只需购买一张飞机票就可以让老朋友即刻出现在自己面前。无论如何，只要彼此心灵相系，距离便无法阻隔异地朋友之间的坚固友情。</p>
<p>另外，搬迁至异地还有其他好处。毫无疑问，每一个城市或国家都拥有自己独特的文化习俗。在新环境中居住可以丰富一个人的人生阅历并拓宽其知识面。与此同时，如果新居住地更发达的话，这还意味着更好的工作机遇。如此，生活水平和教育质量都会得到提高。除此以外，由于环境的变化，一个人的适应能力也会由于生活环境的改变而在很大程度上得到加强。</p>
<p>因此，没有必要因搬至异地而担心失去老朋友。真正牢固的友谊经受得住时空的考验。同时，我们也不应忽视崭新居住氛围中的一些潜在优势。因此，这足以证明，离开家乡去异地生活是个不错的选择。</p>

<h4 id="范文-18"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-18"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>In most people’s eyes, family <strong>get-togethers</strong> are the greatest happiness in life. Indeed, sharing an enjoyable moment with loved ones frees a person from daily pressure and helps him regain a positive state of mind. That is why many families have <strong>set a routine to</strong> have meals together at least once a week. Without doubt, such dinner meetings should be carried on consistently.</p>
<p>To begin with, though a simple thing to do, it helps maintain everlasting family harmony. Admittedly, the fastpaced social life makes it impossible for families to stay together all the time. Busy working and living schedules might be the biggest barrier that undermines good kinships. Unfortunately, <strong>contrary to</strong> the past, more and more adults today have begun to neglect <strong>keeping frequent ties with</strong> family members. Their <strong>stereotypical</strong> lifestyles under heavy workloads prevent them from relating well to their loved ones. In the face of such cruel realities, it is high time to change the situation before it gets serious. Reserving some time for <strong>family reunions</strong> is definitely the most effective way to meet that end. Enjoying meals together occasionally with other family members does not only reunite the hearts of relatives, but also helps establish a higher degree of harmony within the family.</p>
<p>In addition, one’s personal problems might be better solved with the family’s combined suggestions during dinner time. After all, they are always the most honest and helpful. As a matter of fact, the dinner table creates a <strong>platform</strong> for effective family discussions and communications. While eating, people can take advantage of such a precious opportunity to make their problems known to everyone. <strong>In response</strong>, most family members will try to present their opinions of how to solve the problem. Just as a famous saying goes, “Two heads are better than one.” Through sincere exchanges of views, a more satisfactory solution is likely to be found. To illustrate, I was once <strong>confronted</strong> by a difficult choice about my career plan and expressed my hesitations at a family dinner. After <strong>learning about</strong> my trouble, all of them provided constructive advice and considerably enlightened my mind. Thanks to their joint efforts and powerful spiritual support, I was able to <strong>erase</strong> my doubts.</p>
<p>Finally, sharing delicious dishes with the family gives people endless joy. Indeed, what is being enjoyed is not just the good taste of food, but rather happy feelings. Nothing else could be more desirable and appealing than the <strong>caring</strong> smiles shown on the faces of loved ones. During this precious dinner time, people are blessed with a cherished moment to relax and have fun. There is much pleasure to be shared and much happiness to be received in the process of eating together.</p>
<p>Therefore, as the most essential units that make up our whole society, families contribute much to its sustainable stability and harmony. In order to maintain a most favorable state of kinship, all members of society should be encouraged to devote more time to their loved ones. Having dinners <strong>regularly</strong> with them is one of the best ways to demonstrate what happiness really means.</p>

<p>118．家人经常聚餐很重要吗？</p>
<p>在大多数人眼中，家庭团聚是人生最大的幸福。的确，与亲爱的家人共享快乐时光能使一个人从日常压力中解脱出来，并助其恢复积极的心理状态。这就是为什么很多家庭都习惯至少每周聚餐一次。毋庸置疑，这样的习惯应该一直遵循下去。</p>
<p>首先，尽管是件很简单的事，但聚餐有助于维系永久的家庭和谐。必须承认，快节奏的社会生活使家人无法时刻守在一起。繁忙的工作和生活日程表也许是损害良好亲情的最大障碍。不幸的是，与过去不同，如今越来越多的成年人开始忽视与家人保持频繁的联系。在繁重工作负担下机械般的生活方式使其无法与亲人保持很好的联系。面对如此残酷的现实，在后果变得严重之前，是时候该做出改变了。留出一些时间与家人团聚无疑是达到此目的的最有效途径。定期家庭聚餐不仅能将亲人们的心重新连结在一起，而且还有利于家庭更高程度的和谐。</p>
<p>此外，在聚餐时，个人遭遇的问题也可能在家人共同的建议下得以更好地解决。不管怎样，他们始终是最真诚且最能帮助到我们的人。实际上，餐桌为家人搭建起讨论与交流的有效平台。人们可以利用一起就餐的宝贵机会将问题倾诉给家人。于是，他们会尽全力就如何解决问题发表自己的观点。正如一句名言所述，“人多力量大。”通过真诚的意见交换，也许可以找到更令人满意的解决方案。比如，我曾经面临一次艰难的事业抉择，在一次家庭聚餐时我表达了自己的疑虑。在得知我的难题以后，全家人都提出了建设性的意见，这极大地启发了我。多亏了大家的共同努力和强大的精神支持，疑云全部消散了。</p>
<p>最后，与家人分享可口美食将带给大家无限快乐。的确，共同享受的不仅仅是食物的美味，更是幸福的滋味。没有什么能比浮现在亲人脸上那关怀的笑容更称心、更迷人的了。在宝贵的聚餐时光中，人们拥有了轻松和开心的美好时刻。在此过程中，有很多可以分享的喜悦，也有很多可以收获的幸福。</p>
<p>因此，作为构成整个社会最基本的单位，家庭为可持续的稳定和谐作出了巨大贡献。为了维系最佳亲情关系，所有社会成员都应该尽量抽出更多时间与亲人共处。经常进行家庭聚餐就是诠释幸福真正内涵的最佳途径之一。</p>

<h4 id="范文-19"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-19"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>Whenever asked about their old days, my grandparents cannot help telling me about how many <strong>hardships</strong> they experienced in the past. Even today I can still vividly recall the stories describing their <strong>starvation</strong> and <strong>torturing labor</strong>. From the scenes in <strong>TV series</strong> or movies featuring their historical time, the words of my grandparents were further <strong>verified</strong>. Indeed, <strong>in retrospect of</strong> their <strong>long-gone</strong> times, there is every reason to believe that our lives today are much better.</p>
<p>Above all, we are living in peace, which is an important prerequisite of good life. Even though absolute world peace has not yet been realized, the current situations are far more agreeable than that of the past. <strong>International</strong> <strong>relations</strong> have been considerably improved and most countries are <strong>prospering</strong> in peace. The world today will no longer surrender to any regional conflicts or wars and people’s <strong>well-being</strong> is a top concern of many governments around the globe. The possibility of another world war is low. Thus, children in the modern age are able to grow up in harmony and happiness. This could be the sharpest contrast of life when we <strong>recollect</strong> the <strong>time periods</strong> of our ancestors. From this perspective, our lives are much better than theirs.</p>
<p>Secondly, we have better chances to receive high-quality education and get better jobs afterwards. In the past, very few teenagers were granted the chance to study in high schools, not to mention entering a university. Most of them had to <strong>quit school</strong> and start to work at a very early age. Illiteracy used to be a dominating problem in the old society. Conversely, the overall education level has been remarkably enhanced at present. In addition to the reduction in the number of illiterates, students are given more opportunities to receive <strong>collegiate</strong> or even higher degrees, which pave the way for a better future. Meanwhile, the freer job market also establishes a better environment for individuals to fully develop their potential and achieve long-cherished career goals. Needless to say, the accomplishment of personal success further ensures a better life.</p>
<p>Last but not least, life has become much more comfortable and convenient due to social prosperity. Today, ordinary citizens are gaining more wealth than before. Besides <strong>material wealth</strong>, spiritual enjoyment is also <strong>pursued</strong> by the majority of people. As the major beneficiary of advanced technology, modern people are living and working under the assistance of numerous <strong>intelligent devices</strong>, like computers and cell phones. Daily life is also made more pleasant with <strong>a vast supply of</strong> various recreation choices. Looking back to the past, our grandparents were indeed leading a harder and less enjoyable life.</p>
<p>Needless to say, through the sharp contrasts of different perspectives, it is easy to conclude that we are more fortunate than our grandparents. Visualizing their hardships under those tough situations, all modern youth can fully cherish a happier life today. Thus, there is no excuse for us to waste any precious time. Instead, we ought to <strong>succeed</strong> the strong spirit of our ancestors and struggle bravely for a brighter tomorrow.</p>

<p>119．我们现在的日子比祖父母小时候的日子要好吗？</p>
<p>每当问及他们的过去，爷爷奶奶总是禁不住告诉我他们过去曾经经受过多少苦难。直至今天，我仍然能清晰地回忆起描述他们当年挨饿做苦工的故事。从有关他们那段历史时期题材的电视剧或电影的场景中，我进一步证实了那些故事的真实性。的确，回顾往昔悠悠岁月，我们完全有理由相信：我们今天的生活比那时好多了。</p>
<p>首先，我们生活在和平年代，这是好日子的重要前提。尽管绝对的世界和平尚未实现，但当今形势远比过去和缓多了。国际关系得到了极大改善，大多数国家都在和平中繁荣发展。当今世界不再屈服于任何地区冲突或战争，人民的幸福是全球很多政府关注的头等大事。另一次世界大战爆发的可能性颇低。因此，今天的孩子能在和谐与幸福的环境中成长。这与我们祖辈生活的年代形成了极其强烈的对比。鉴于此，我们的日子的确过得比他们好。</p>
<p>第二，我们有更好的机会去接受高质量的教育并在之后获得更理想的工作。过去，青少年难得有机会上中学，更不用说上大学了。他们大都不得不辍学，并在年纪很小的时候就开始工作。在旧社会，文盲是一个普遍的社会问题。相反，现在整体教育水平已经得到了显著的提升。除了文盲数量的减少，学生们还有更多取得大学或更高学位的机会，这些为更美好的未来铺平了道路。与此同时，更加开放的人才市场也为充分发挥个人潜力创造了更有利的环境，从而帮助人们实现长远职业目标。不言而喻，个人成功是过上更好日子的进一步保证。</p>
<p>最后，由于社会繁荣，生活已经变得更加舒适与方便了。如今，普通老百姓获得了比从前更多的财富。除了物质财富，大多数人也同时追求精神享受。作为先进科技的主要受益者，现代人在无数智能设备的协助下生活与工作，如电脑和手机。由于有多种多样的娱乐方式可供选择，日常生活也充满了更多乐趣。回顾过去，我们祖辈的确过着更为艰难且极端乏味的日子。</p>
<p>毫无疑问，从不同方面的鲜明对比不难看出，我们的确比祖辈更幸运。回想往昔那些艰苦的岁月，所有现代青年会更珍惜今天的幸福生活。因此，我们没有任何理由浪费分秒的宝贵时间。相反，我们应该继承前辈的伟大精神，向更加光明的未来奋勇前进。</p>

<h4 id="范文-20"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-20"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>No effort is being spared to improve the quality of education. The emergence of diversified proposals on reforms and innovations fully demonstrate the passionate concern from the public. Some people suggest that students should be asked to evaluate their teachers. This notion has won much <strong>applause</strong>, and owing to its potential merits, I express my agreement.</p>
<p>Above all, students are in the most qualified position to assess their teachers. As the direct <strong>recipient</strong> of knowledge and instruction, students truly possess the ability to give judgments about their own teachers. In a sense, the classroom functions as a grand stage on which the teachers are playing a leading role. Their impact reaches the audience <strong>instantly</strong>. With the passing of time, those who have witnessed their performances in class will gradually obtain the most objective and comprehensive understanding about their teacher’s character, teaching methods, attitude, values and spirit. The students, who play the part of viewers and <strong>critics</strong>, have mastered almost all the qualities <strong>required</strong> in an <strong>assessor</strong>. They may frequently ask themselves if their learning efficiency has been enhanced due to diligent help from their teachers. Thus, it is not exaggeration to say that the students’ evaluation should be the <strong>closest to reality</strong>.</p>
<p>As for the teachers, they might be motivated to raise their level of teaching. Psychologically speaking, no teacher wishes to lose <strong>self-respect</strong> by receiving <strong>poor scores</strong> from the students. Determined to achieve the best results, they would definitely <strong>go all-out to</strong> improve themselves. The <strong>reminders</strong> from their students would keep urging them to perform their best both in and out of class. Thus, such powerful mental pressure might be turned into the impetus to create better teaching methods, thereby making their classes more lively and effective. Besides, greater importance will be attached to the students’ <strong>responses during the course of</strong> teaching. These actions all pave the way for the quality-enhancement of school education.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, students may also be inspired to make progress in the process of the evaluation task. In most cases, when offered the right to judge their teachers, they will naturally <strong>feel honored</strong> to <strong>exercise</strong> such a significant power. A strong sense of responsibility might also rise up. As a result, the intensified self-consciousness might encourage them to <strong>be stricter with</strong> themselves so as to become more qualified to assess others. Being in such a mental state, they would strive to accomplish <strong>self-promotion</strong> along with their teachers.</p>
<p>In short, if this suggestion could be accepted and adopted by school authorities, it would benefit both teachers and students. As a matter of fact, efficient education should be a <strong>two-way process</strong> that involves mutual evaluation and support between the two. Therefore, with the purpose of promoting the sacred cause of education to a brand new level, each side ought to play a significant part.</p>

<p>120．学校应该让学生评价他们的老师吗？</p>
<p>全社会都在不遗余力地改善教育质量。各种改革创新提议的涌现充分显示出公众的热切关注。有些人建议学生应该被要求评价自己的老师。这个意向已经赢得了很多掌声。由于其潜在的优点，对此我也表示赞同。</p>
<p>首先，学生最有资格评价自己的老师。作为知识和指导的直接接受者，学生的确有能力对自己的老师作出判断。在某种意义上，教室可作为一个宽广的舞台，在那里，老师扮演主角。他们的影响会立即抵达观众。随着时间的推移，在课堂上目睹了老师表现的学生会逐渐对其性格、教学方法、态度、价值观以及精神有最客观、全面的认知。学生其实扮演着评论家和批评家的角色，他们几乎已掌握了评论者具备的所有素质。他们会不断询问自己老师的辛勤教导是否提高了他们的学习效率。因此，若认为学生的评价最贴近现实，这一点儿也不夸张。</p>
<p>对于教师，这项提议可能促使他们提高教学水平。从心理角度来讲，没有一位教师情愿因获得学生较低的评分而丧失自尊。为了达到最好成绩，他们必定会竭尽全力完善自我。来自学生的提醒将一直敦促他们在课内外都有最佳表现。于是，这种强大的精神压力会转化为开创更好教学方法的动力，从而使他们的课堂更生动、更高效。此外，教师还会更重视教学过程中与学生的互动。这些都为学校教育质量的提高铺平了道路。</p>
<p>与此同时，在履行评价任务期间，学生也有可能受到鼓舞并立志取得进步。在大多数情况下，如果学生获得了评价老师的特权，他们会很自然地因行使如此重要的权力而感到荣幸。一种强烈的责任感也随即油然而生。于是，增强的自我意识会鼓励他们更严格地要求自己，以使自己变得更有资格去评价他人。由于这种心理状态，他们将与老师共同努力实现自我提升。</p>
<p>简言之，如果这项议案获得认可并被校方采纳的话，它将给师生都带来益处。其实，高效教学应是一个双向的过程，涉及互相的评价与支持。因此，为了将神圣的教育事业提升至一个崭新的高度，师生双方都应起着至关重要的作用。</p>

<h4 id="范文-21"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-21"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>Whenever there is the chance to spend a moment in leisure, everyone is filled with joy and passion. However, regarding how to spend it, people may <strong>react</strong> differently. Some are active planners who tend to <strong>draft out</strong> a careful schedule for their activities, while others may <strong>stay calm</strong> without doing any preparations <strong>in advance</strong>. If I were granted the opportunity to be free <strong>for a while</strong>, I would rather spend it as freely as possible and never make a plan.</p>
<p>To begin with, free time ought to be enjoyed without any pressure. What is supposed to be the major purpose for people to go on a holiday? Undoubtedly, the primary reason lies in the freedom to relax. Having a moment to set the mind free and stay away from mental pressure should be the greatest benefit people can receive from it. During their busy working hours, most white collar workers have to stick to <strong>rigid</strong> plans and work under tight schedules. Seldom do they have the chance to rest. Thus, when the blessed moment of leisure arrives, they are most willing to get rid of any burden <strong>placed upon</strong> them. If there is still a <strong>carefully-made</strong> plan to fulfill during the vacation time, in no way can they enjoy themselves to their heart’s content. The schedule may keep urging them to complete all the tasks <strong>step by step</strong>, negatively affecting the relaxing mood.</p>
<p>In fact, most people may <strong>confess</strong> that plans are easy to make yet extremely difficult to follow. Before making a plan, they may <strong>harbor</strong> great ambitions and <strong>schedule out</strong> a series of events diligently, including comparing and deciding on varied choices, <strong>looking up</strong> information from numerous sources, and thinking out all the preparations that have to be done <strong>beforehand</strong>. All these duties can be performed with ease. However, some planners may neglect to consider the complicated nature of putting their ambitious plans into practice. Even if they finally manage to complete the plan, the process might not be relaxing or enjoyable. My cousin used to be an enthusiastic planner. Before his week-long holiday last year, he put forward a detailed <strong>timetable</strong> and traveled to 10 different places in only 7 days. When he came back, he was totally exhausted and frustrated. From then on, he refused to make any holiday plans.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the plan finally <strong>turns out to be</strong> unfulfilled, emotions of regret might conquer their hearts. In most cases, as soon as there is a plan ahead a person’s psychological response might be to complete it <strong>to</strong> <strong>the best degree</strong>. Unfortunately, the outcome may go against his high expectations: when failure really occurs, he may <strong>be trapped with</strong> self-complaints and depression, which inevitably prevent a good mood during a holiday.</p>
<p>As a consequence, it is unnecessary to consume too much energy in making detailed plans for leisure activities. Admittedly, the ability to plan is of great importance to a person’s individual development, yet it does not have to be adopted in leisurely moments. <strong>Otherwise</strong>, the real function of holidays might be undermined. Indeed, the best way to enjoy free time is to have no pressing plan to follow.</p>

<p>121．对闲暇时间计划与否？</p>
<p>每当有机会享受片刻闲暇时，每个人心中都会充满无限快乐与热情。然而，对于如何度过这段时光，人们的态度不尽相同。一些积极的策划者倾向于起草详细的活动安排表，而其他人则泰然自若，不做任何事先准备。如果我有机会获得片刻的闲暇，我宁可自由自在，不做任何计划。</p>
<p>首先，休闲时光应该在毫无压力的状态下享受。究竟人们度假的主要目的是什么呢？毋庸置疑，主要就在于能够拥有让自己轻松的自由。利用一段时间放松思绪、远离心理压力，这应是休假带给人们的最大好处。在繁忙的工作时间里，大多数白领不得不遵守严格的计划并在紧凑的日程下工作。他们很少有休息机会。因此，当宝贵的休闲时光到来的时候，他们最大的愿望就是摆脱所有加在他们身上的负担。如果此时仍然有详细的计划去执行，那么，他们是无论如何也不可能尽情享受休闲时光的。计划表会促使他们按部就班地完成所有的任务，从而消极地影响了放松的情绪。</p>
<p>其实，大多数人都会承认，计划很容易制订却极难遵循。在做计划之前，他们也许雄心勃勃，不知疲倦地列出一系列活动，包括衡量并确定多种选择、从海量资源里查阅信息、考虑提前要做的所有准备工作等。所有这些计划很容易制订，然而，一些策划者也许忽略了将其雄心壮志的计划付诸实践的艰难。即使最后他们完成了计划，过程也许不是轻松快乐的。我的表弟曾经就是一位积极的策划者。去年，在一周假期开始之前，他制订了详细的时间表，并在仅仅7天之内游览了10个不同的地方。旅行归来的时候，他已经变得疲惫不堪。从那时起，他再也不做任何假期计划了。</p>
<p>另一方面，如果计划最终未能得到圆满执行，计划者会产生懊悔的情绪。在大多数情况下，只要有计划在眼前，一个人的心理反应就是尽可能出色地完成。不幸的是，结果往往与高期望相悖。当失败真正来临时，他／她也许会陷入自我埋怨和消沉之中，这难免会影响假期的良好心境。</p>
<p>因此，没有必要花费过多精力为休闲活动制订详细的计划。不能否认，计划能力对一个人的个人发展很重要，然而这种能力不必应用在休闲时光里。否则，休假的真正价值就会遭到破坏。实际上，享受闲暇时光的最佳途径就是：不制订任何必须遵守的紧迫计划。</p>

<h4 id="范文-22"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-22"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>In <strong>Francis Bacon’s</strong> eyes, books could serve human beings in various ways, “…either for pleasure, or for <strong>ornament</strong>, or for ability.” <strong>Factually</strong>, there are so many types of good books that it is difficult to <strong>summarize</strong> their <strong>goodness</strong> with simple words. As long as readers are able to gain some benefit from the books they have gone through, these books are all worth reading. Thus, it is nave to be confined to certain types of books. Not only should people read those about real events, real people and <strong>established facts,</strong> but also other kinds of books might be beneficial to readers.</p>
<p>Admittedly, books written on the basis of realities are valuable and helpful to most people. Just like a huge <strong>treasure house</strong>, books of this kind may store the real-life experience of those who have accomplished <strong>marvelous</strong> individual success. For instance, <strong>biographies</strong> and <strong>autobiographies</strong> often include the <strong>anecdotes</strong> of public figures, detailed <strong>illustration</strong> of their endeavors and the spiritual qualities shown in the process. Among them <em>Steve Jobs; A Biography</em> should be brought up as a shining representative example. As soon as the book was written, translated and distributed after the <strong>tragic</strong> death of this legendary talent, it took the world by storm. The unparalleled sales volume perfectly indicates the <strong>unimpeachable</strong> values encompassed within it. Buyers pay for the book not just because of awe and respect, but because of their eagerness to learn from his exceptional career and life as the creator and CEO of Apple Computers.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, <strong>science fiction</strong> and mystery stories also deserve reading. Even though they are generally based on the writer’s imagination and creativity, they are still worthwhile to the masses. Reading these books not only fills people with joy, but also trains their minds and provokes deeper thoughts. To illustrate, from the magical <strong>fantasies</strong> depicted in science fiction, scientists’ inspiration might be sparked. Thus, they are likely to come up with new <strong>hypotheses</strong>, which will lead to new breakthroughs in their research.</p>
<p>Furthermore, such works as <strong>fairy tales, comics</strong> and cartoons should be recommended as well. Innocent children are the biggest beneficiaries of these books. Reading legendary stories and appreciating fancy drawings will for sure enrich their souls. They are guiding children into a colorful wonderland where they can sense the miracles created by the powerful minds of the writers. Meanwhile, they are also motivated to use their own imaginations to establish a visualized <strong>kingdom</strong> for themselves. In the process, children’s brains are developed. I suppose most of us must have read many fairy tales in childhood. Vivid characters like Snow White, the Little Mermaid, and the Little Prince used to be our fancied companions and are now still being cherished deeply in our memories.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, it is the destined value of all good books to provide humans with food for thought. Being limited to only one type of books might considerably narrow a reader’s mind and knowledge scope. Thus, everyone should feel honored when gaining access to a vast variety of good books. They simply resemble the close friends we have made. In spite of the differences, they are all helpful and faithful companions who deserve our life-long attention.</p>

<p>122．人们应该只阅读那些描写真人真事的书籍吗？</p>
<p>在弗朗西斯·培根的眼中，书籍以各种方式服务于人类，“……或为怡情，或为博彩，或为长才”。其实，好的书籍种类繁多，很难用简单的语言概括其好处。只要读者能从他们读过的书中有所收获，这些书都值得一读。因此，将阅读范围仅仅局限于某一些类型的书籍是幼稚的。人们不仅应阅读有关真事、真人、真理的书，其他类别的书籍也对读者有益。</p>
<p>必须承认，基于现实创作的书籍对大多数人都是有价值、有帮助的。如同一座巨大的宝库，此类书籍储藏着卓越的成功者真实的人生经历。例如，传记和自传通常包含公众人物的轶事、对其奋斗历程的详尽描述以及他们的精神品质。其中《史蒂夫·乔布斯传》就是一部光辉的有代表性的典范作品。此书创作于这位传奇人物的悲剧离世之后，它一经翻译和发行就很快征服了全世界。无敌的销量完美地证明了其内在的超凡价值。读者并非仅仅出于对乔布斯的敬畏和尊重而购买此书，人们更渴望从苹果公司创始人独特的事业和人生中学到知识。</p>
<p>然而，科幻小说、悬疑小说也值得一读。尽管这些书都是基于作者的想象和创造力完成的，它们对大众仍然是有价值的。阅读此类书不仅使人们感到愉悦，还能训练思维并引发更深入的思考。例如，科幻小说中描绘的神奇幻想也许能激起科学家的灵感。于是，他们可能会构建新假说，进而在研究中获得崭新的突破。</p>
<p>此外，诸如童话、漫画和卡通之类的作品也应被推荐。天真的孩子是此类书的最大受益者。阅读神话故事、欣赏曼妙图画的确能丰富他们的思想境界。它们带领孩子走进多彩的神奇世界，在那里，他们可以感受到作者的强大想象力所创造的奇迹。与此同时，他们也可能受到启示，运用自己的想象构建出属于自己的一个可视的王国。在这个过程中，孩子的智力得到了开发。想必我们小时候大都读过许多童话故事。白雪公主、小美人鱼、小王子等生动的人物曾经是我们幻想中的伙伴，直至今天还记忆犹新。</p>
<p>其实，所有好书的固有价值都在于为人类提供精神食粮。仅仅局限于单一类型的图书会极大限制读者的思想和知识面。因此，在有机会阅读多种好书的时候，每个人应该感到荣幸。这些书就好比我们亲密的朋友，尽管各不相同，它们都对我们有所帮助，并且是值得我们永久关注的可信赖的伙伴。</p>

<h4 id="范文-23"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-23"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>Nowadays, making money is a common goal shared by numerous people. Those who have become wealthy always <strong>win admiration from</strong> others. However, we should never directly <strong>equate</strong> success <strong>with</strong> money. Attaching too much to financial gains <strong>inherently</strong> neglects the essential elements that truly make up success. In other words, it is too rash to say that only people who earn <strong>vast sums of</strong> money are successful.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the ability to make money can never be the indicator of a person’s success. It is his achievements and individual values that demonstrate his success. There is no denying that among the most successful figures, some may possess billions of dollars. However, their wealth is merely one of the rewards of their efforts. But for their excellent accomplishments, they would never have <strong>been noted as</strong> successful no matter how large their <strong>personal property</strong> is. After Tomas Edison invented the <strong>electric bulb</strong> and other useful devices, he became a successful man. It was these great inventions and his unremitting efforts that brought about his unimpeachable success. Though he was financially supported and honored afterwards, money still <strong>had little to do</strong> <strong>with</strong> his brilliant success. In fact, similar representative examples can be found throughout human history.</p>
<p>Second, the means by which people earn money are diversified. In modern society, an increasing number of people have been included in the wealthy class. Of course, not every one of them could be defined as successful. From a certain perspective, money can be easily gained whereas success can never be obtained with ease. For instance, an ordinary citizen could become an <strong>overnight millionaire</strong> only because he has won a lottery. What’s more, with the attempt of making bigger profits, some businessmen even cheat the customers in various immoral ways, including manufacturing and selling fake products, conducting cyber and telephone frauds, distributing misleading advertisements and so forth. The huge amount of money earned from such evil deeds can only serve as <strong>evidence</strong> that leads to <strong>severe punishment</strong>.</p>
<p>Actually, in spite of <strong>noteworthy</strong> successes, people may still live <strong>humble</strong> lives. Remaining low-profile constitutes another distinguished quality found in a successful individual. Their attention might possibly be focused on <strong>incessant</strong> efforts to accomplish bigger successes in the future, rather than on instant personal gains. Looking back on history, many world-renowned writers, painters and thinkers were still in poverty even when they passed away. Among them <strong>Picasso</strong>, the outstanding Spanish Painter, is a shining model. Without doubt, those who dream of achieving success should learn from these types of successful people.</p>
<p>All in all, even though successful individuals deserve <strong>monetary</strong> reward, it does not mean money-making symbolizes their success. On the contrary, those who manage to make great fortunes might be absolute losers who fail to obey social morals. Thus, success may have little to do with wealth. Under no circumstance should we judge a person from his ability to earn money.</p>

<p>123．只有有钱人才是成功的？</p>
<p>如今，挣钱是无数人的共同目标。那些富翁总是会赢得他人的羡慕。然而，我们不应直接将成功与金钱等同起来。太注重经济利益会导致对真正成功要素的忽视。换句话说，不应过于轻率地认为“只有挣很多钱的人才是成功的”。</p>
<p>首先，赚钱能力并非是一个人成功的表现。成就与个人价值才是成功的体现。不可否认，在大多数成功人士当中，有些可能是亿万富翁。然而，他们拥有的财富仅仅是对其所付出努力的奖励之一。如果没有杰出的成就，无论个人财产有多么雄厚，他们永远也不可能被公认为“成功”。在托马斯·爱迪生发明了电灯和其他有用的设备之后，他成了一位成功者。是这些伟大发明和他的不懈努力造就了他卓越的成功。尽管他随后获得了经济资助和奖赏，但金钱仍然与他的辉煌成功关联甚微。实际上，人类历史中类似的代表性例子举不胜举。</p>
<p>第二，人们挣钱的方式各异。在现代社会，越来越多的人加入了富裕阶层。当然，他们并非人人都是所谓的成功者。从某个角度来看，钱很好挣，而成功却很难得。例如，一名普通百姓可能只是因为中了彩票而一夜暴富。此外，为了获得更大利润，有些商人甚至通过各种不道德途径欺骗消费者，包括生产和销售假冒商品、进行网络和电话诈骗、传播误导性广告等。通过这些罪恶行为挣得的大笔钱只能作为对他们进行严惩的证据。</p>
<p>其实，尽管取得了显著的成功，有的人可能仍然过着贫寒的生活。保持低调是成功者具备的另一个超凡品质。他们也许集中精力为未来更大的成功继续拼搏，而不会注重眼前的个人所得。纵观历史，很多举世闻名的作家、画家和思想家即便在去世的时候仍很贫穷。其中西班牙杰出画家毕加索就是一个光辉的典范。毋庸置疑，渴望成功的人都应该向这些类型的成功人士学习。</p>
<p>总之，尽管成功者理应获得金钱的奖励，但这并不意味着挣钱象征成功。恰恰相反，那些挣大钱的人也可能是违背社会公德的绝对败类。因此，成功与财富的关联甚微。在任何情况下我们都不应该从一个人挣钱的能力来判断他／她是否成功。</p>

<h4 id="范文-24"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-24"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>With ampler supplies of commodities in the market, consumers are facing more choices today. Thus, it has been a routine for potential buyers to <strong>make comparisons</strong> before deciding on the most satisfactory choices. Criteria for their judgment may <strong>be associated with</strong> a number of elements, including personal preferences, specific functions, and unique features among others. Some people prefer to select items made by hand, while others would select those made by machine. In my opinion, machine-made products are more advantageous.</p>
<p>In the first place, <strong>volume production</strong> considerably <strong>cuts down</strong> the prices of items made by machine. Advanced technology should be the major contributor to the enhanced productivity of modern industry. The installation of machines enables factories to produce more at higher speeds. Thus, the costs have been <strong>brought down</strong> to a large degree. Consumers might be able to buy them at reasonable prices. By contrast, <strong>hand-made</strong> items like clothes and furniture require much more energy and time for manufacture. Inevitably, people have to pay more for it. Nowadays, the number of wise consumers is on the rise. Very few of them are willing to select more expensive goods. Thereafter, machine-made commodities, which are <strong>mostly</strong> cheaper, might become the first choice.</p>
<p>In the second place, the quality of machine-made commodities can be better ensured. Thanks to the improved working efficiency and the higher degree of <strong>intelligence</strong>, modern machines are able to fulfill complicated orders <strong>automatically</strong> and <strong>accurately</strong>. Thus, all the items on the <strong>production line</strong> are undergoing <strong>preset</strong> procedures so that each one could meet the qualified standard. Normally, it is far beyond the weak power of humans to <strong>ascertain</strong> that every tiny detail is dealt with. Any neglect of details might negatively affect the overall quality of a hand-made product. Without doubt, superior quality is the top concern of all potential buyers. No one wishes to spend money on objects of low quality.</p>
<p>To some extent, purchasing machine-made products helps <strong>step up</strong> the progress of <strong>industrialization</strong>. As long as there is a higher demand of commodities produced by machine, manufacturers might be motivated to update their equipments in time. Then more attention may be focused on renovating relevant technology that can be adopted in developing machines with better functions. With this regard, it will bring the process of industrialization forward.</p>
<p>And so, more merits are found in machine-made items. In spite of the possibility that hand-made goods might be unique in features, the traditional way of production has led to their backwardness in many qualities. In addition, due to their comparatively higher prices, consumers might be <strong>hesitant</strong> before deciding to buy them.</p>

<p>124．你喜欢手工制品还是机器制品？</p>
<p>由于商品更充足的市场供应，如今消费者面临着更多的选择。因此，潜在买家通常会在作出最满意的决定之前对不同商品进行比较。判断标准与一系列因素有关，包括个人偏好、特定用途和在同类产品中的特色。有些人倾向选择手工制品，而其他人则偏向机器制品。我认为，机器制品更占优势。</p>
<p>首先，批量生产极大地降低了机器制品的价格。发达的科技是现代工业生产率提高的主要贡献者。机器的安装使工厂能够更高速地生产产品。因此，成本大大降低了。消费者可以以合理的价格购买。相比之下，生产衣服、家具之类的手工制品需要更多的精力和时间，人们难免会支付更高的价格。当今，精明的消费者越来越多了，很少人愿意选择更昂贵的商品。因此，相对廉价的机器制品是大多数人的首选。</p>
<p>其次，机器制品的质量会得到更好的保证。由于工作效率和智能化程度的提高，现代机器能够自动精确地完成复杂的指令。于是，生产线上的所有产品都按照预先设定的程序制造而成，每一件都能达到合格标准。通常情况下，弱小的人力很难确保所有微小的细节都完美无缺，而稍有疏忽就会影响手工制品的整体质量。毫无疑问，质量优劣是所有潜在消费者关注的头等大事，没有人愿意花钱购买质量差的商品。</p>
<p>在某种程度上，购买机器制品有助于促进工业化进程。只要机器制品的需求量增加，生厂商就有及时改进生产设备的动力。于是，更多的注意力就会集中在相关技术的革新之上，这些技术可应用于开发性能更好的机器。鉴于此，这将促进工业化进程。</p>
<p>因此，机器制品拥有更多的优点。尽管手工制品可能很有特色，但这种传统生产方式会导致质量的落后。此外，由于其相对高昂的价格，消费者也许会犹豫是否决定购买。</p>

<h4 id="范文-25"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-25"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>There have been frequent cases of conflicts between <strong>business dealers</strong> and their <strong>customers</strong>. The causes of complaints might <strong>range from</strong> poor service to low quality or even deliberate fraud. Whenever these troubles occur, some consumers choose to complain in person, while others prefer to write <strong>letters of complaint</strong>. As far as I am concerned, the more proper way to complain is in writing.</p>
<p>Above all, more detailed information can be included in letters, thus making it easier to solve the problems. Before <strong>getting down to</strong> writing an article, every writer has to <strong>organize his thoughts</strong>. Without such a <strong>preparatory</strong> <strong>step</strong>, the <strong>essay</strong> could never be completed logically. The same is true with <strong>letter-writing</strong>. What are the problems that they have encountered? What might be the cause of those troubles? What responsibilities must the dealer take? What are the ideal solutions? All these questions must be <strong>weighed</strong> on the consumer’s mind beforehand. While writing the letter, he should include each aspect of his pre-organized ideas. <strong>Writing techniques</strong> can also be adopted so as to make the letter more <strong>persuasive</strong> and effective. Indeed, there is enough time for the consumer to finish a letter which has clarified all the essential points. After reading the letter, the blamed side may give a careful consideration about the issue and try to <strong>settle down</strong> the troubles as early as possible.</p>
<p>Besides, writing may help prevent further conflicts sparked by hostile sentiments from the two sides. When a person is <strong>in anger</strong>, his <strong>oral expressions</strong> may be out of his control. Thus, during the attempt to complain about the problems <strong>face-to-face</strong>, the consumer is likely to lose his temper. Impolite words or even <strong>rude arguments</strong> might unconsciously arise, which lead to a greater protesting mood on the other side. As a matter of fact, in our daily life, quarrels between customers and <strong>salesmen</strong> can often be seen in shops. Under such tense circumstances, the chances of peacefully meeting the complainer’s requirements are slim. On the contrary, a higher degree of conflict might be on the verge of <strong>breaking out</strong>. Needless to say, writing a letter is a <strong>smart</strong> way to avoid such a severe situation. Treating the problems rationally will surely enhance the possibility of smooth settlement and mutual satisfaction.</p>
<p>Finally, sending letters of complaint may also urge the dealers to improve their services in the future. Regarding the content of such letters, some <strong>sensible complainers</strong> might add constructive suggestions for the dealers. Their sincere advice might help promote the quality of service. Therefore, it should be considered a privilege for businesses to gain some ideas that are useful to their self-development. They may adopt them modestly and strive to avoid making similar faults in days to come. Moreover, if a dealer finally manages to do it, the lost customers might come back again.</p>
<p>To conclude, after listing all the favorable points about writing letters of complaint, we may naturally realize the great importance of rationality. Without doubt, in order to avoid <strong>making matters worse</strong>, customers must try to treat the problem seriously and carefully. Complaining in letters is a better way for both sides to achieve the most satisfactory outcomes.</p>

<p>125．书面投诉还是当面投诉？</p>
<p>商家与消费者的冲突时有发生。投诉的原因可能包括劣质服务、低质量，甚至故意欺诈。每当此类麻烦出现的时候，有些消费者选择当面投诉，而有些人则更愿意写投诉信。我认为，通过写信的方式投诉更合适。</p>
<p>首先，投诉信里包含更详细的信息，从而使问题更容易解决。在提笔写文章之前，每位作者都必须整理思绪。若没有这一步准备工作，文章就无法具有逻辑性。信件书写也是同样的道理。他们遇到了什么问题？导致这些问题的起因可能是什么？商家必须担负何种责任？理想的解决方案是什么？所有这些问题都必须事先在消费者头脑中斟酌。写信的时候，应该将所有方面都涵盖其中。写作技巧的应用还会使投诉信更有说服效果。的确，消费者有充足的时间书写一封清晰阐明所有重点的投诉信。在阅读之后，遭到投诉的一方也许会慎重考虑涉及的问题，并试图尽快解决。</p>
<p>此外，写信有助于防止由双方敌对情绪引发的进一步冲突。当一个人生气的时候，他／她的口头表达有可能失去控制。于是，在试图当面投诉某些问题的过程中，消费者可能会发脾气，随即无意识地会出现不礼貌的言语乃至粗鲁的争论，这会使对方产生更强烈的抵触情绪。其实，在日常生活中，我们时常会看到商店里顾客与店员之间的争吵。在这种紧张的氛围中，以和平方式满足投诉方需求的几率会很低。相反，还可能发生更严重的冲突。不言而喻，写信是避免这种严重局面的明智方法。理智地处理问题必将提高顺利且双方都满意地解决问题的可能性。</p>
<p>最后，发送投诉信还可能促使商家在未来改善服务。有些明智的投诉者会在信中给商家提出建设性的意见。他们真诚的建议也许有助于提高服务质量。因此，获得有利于自我发展的建议应该是企业的荣幸。他们可能谦虚地采纳这些建议，并努力避免将来犯类似的错误。此外，倘若商家最终实现了自我改善，失去的顾客有可能再回来。</p>
<p>总而言之，在列举了写投诉信的所有优点之后，我们会自然而然地意识到理智的重要。毫无疑问，为了避免把事情变得更糟糕，消费者必须尽力严肃并慎重地对待问题。若想使双方都获得最满意的结果，写投诉信是更好的选择。</p>

<h4 id="范文-26"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-26"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>Different people have unique ways to define music, which <strong>boasts</strong> numerous fans world-wide. It may <strong>be</strong> <strong>compared to</strong> a good medicine for the soul, or it could be labeled as an international language without borders. Indeed, whenever topics concerning music have been <strong>brought up</strong>, there is always much to discuss. From my view, music does not merely serve for recreation, but also possesses other significant qualities that deserve people’s attention.</p>
<p>To begin with, music can help people <strong>calm down from</strong> tension and pressure. According to psychologists, listening to gentle melodies relaxes people’s minds and erases their <strong>nerves</strong>. In our daily life, we may frequently encounter troubles that drag us into overwhelming nervousness or pressure. Whenever such a situation occurs, it might be a habitual choice for many people to take out their CDs and <strong>bathe themselves in</strong> soft music. There is no need to understand all the <strong>lyrics</strong>. The only thing to do is to appreciate the slow and appealing <strong>notes</strong>. As a matter of fact, a variety of music is qualified to be a <strong>cure</strong> to mental problems. For instance, the <strong>Chinese classic music</strong> played by traditional musical instruments like the erhu, <strong>the flute and the lute</strong> can meet this need. Among the most famous <strong>masterpieces</strong>, <em>Er Quan Ying Yue</em> (<em>Two Springs Reflect the Moon</em>) is a brilliant example. Besides, American country music, <strong>tender</strong> love songs as well as children’s songs are all magical medicines that can help people return to a peaceful state of mind.</p>
<p>Furthermore, music gives people endless inspirations. <strong>Brain workers</strong>, including white collars, writers and designers, may be the biggest beneficiaries. The major portion of their work is based on creativity. In other words, pursuing all sources of inspiration is their destined mission. To illustrate, my friend Linda is a <strong>fashion designer</strong>. While she is working, she usually listens to a piece of <strong>jazz</strong> so as to obtain enlightening inspirations. This habit really works well and helps her sketch out many superior-quality <strong>blueprints</strong>. Actually, even the <strong>composers</strong> themselves are mental workers. Their creative works are rendering inspiration to other <strong>professionals</strong>. They might even be inspired by the pieces created by other <strong>musicians</strong>.</p>
<p>Last but not least, on special occasions, music may have more specialized functions. For example, during all kinds of parties, playing music is an indispensable part that no one neglects.* Happy Birthday* is the most popular song sung on birthdays, while <em>Wedding Dash</em> is a popular choice at wedding time. Dance music like <em>the Blue Danube</em> or <strong>rock and roll</strong> might be chosen for dance parties. Evidently, such occasions can never do without music.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, it is beyond our power to <strong>generalize</strong> all the charms and merits of music. With the advancement of society, people today are attaching greater importance to the pursuit of <strong>spiritual comfort</strong>. Music is doubtlessly qualified to <strong>satisfy that need</strong>. Meanwhile, all musicians and other music professionals should strive to create more excellent works.</p>

<p>126．音乐为什么对很多人非常重要？</p>
<p>世界上有无数的音乐迷，不同的人对音乐的定义也不尽相同。它既可以是灵魂的良药，也可以是没有国界的国际语言。的确，每当提起有关音乐的话题时，总有说不完的内容。在我看来，音乐不仅仅为娱乐服务，它还拥有其他值得人们关注的重要特质。</p>
<p>首先，音乐有助于人们从紧张和压力中平静下来。心理学家认为，倾听柔和的旋律可以放松心绪、消除不安。在日常生活中，我们经常遇到一些麻烦，从而陷入难以抗拒的紧张和压力之中。每当这种情况出现时，很多人都习惯拿出CD，将自己沉浸于轻柔的音乐中。无需听懂所有的歌词，唯一要做的就是欣赏那舒缓迷人的音符。其实，很多种音乐都可作为医治心理问题的妙方。例如，由二胡、长笛和琵琶等传统乐器演奏的中国古典音乐就是一剂良药。在众多的名曲当中，《二泉映月》可谓经典之作。此外，美国乡村音乐、温柔的爱情歌曲以及儿童歌曲都是有助于人们恢复平静心态的良药。</p>
<p>除此之外，音乐给予人们无限的灵感。包括白领、作家、设计师在内的脑力工作者也许是最大的受益人。他们的工作大都基于创造力。换句话说，追求各种灵感是他们的固有使命。比如，我的好朋友琳达是一位服装设计师。她经常边工作边聆听爵士乐以获得启发式的灵感。这个习惯的确很奏效，并已经帮助她设计出了很多高质量的图样。其实，甚至作曲家自己也是脑力工作者，他们创造性的作品为其他行业人士提供灵感之源，而他们也可能从其他音乐家的乐曲那里获得灵感。</p>
<p>最后但同样重要的，在特殊场合，音乐有更特殊的功用。例如，在各种聚会上，音乐就是必不可少和不容忽视的一部分。《生日快乐歌》是过生日时最受欢迎的歌曲，而《婚礼进行曲》则是婚礼时的常选曲目。《蓝色多瑙河》之类的舞曲以及摇滚乐在舞会时可以派上用场。很显然，这些场合是离不开音乐的。</p>
<p>事实上，我们很难概括出音乐所有的迷人之处和优点。随着社会的进步，如今的人们越来越重视追求精神安慰。音乐无疑是理想之选。与此同时，所有的音乐家和其他音乐从业者应该努力创作出更多优秀的作品。</p>

<h3 id="127buy-a-house-or-a-business"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#127buy-a-house-or-a-business"></a> 127．Buy a house or a business?</h3>
<h4 id="范文-27"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-27"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>If there is enough money at hand, how would you spend it? Undoubtedly, people may <strong>react differently to</strong> this question and give <strong>diverse</strong> answers. Among them, purchasing a house and owning a business might be two of the most frequently chosen paths. It is indeed a hard decision to make. I would rather purchase a business.</p>
<p>First of all, it provides a <strong>grand platform</strong> to train and test a person’s <strong>all-round</strong> abilities. Undoubtedly, the owner of a business has the freedom to <strong>get involved in</strong> all aspects of work. For instance, he plays the major role in making important decisions and drafting future plans while also employing and training new staff, supervising quality of work, allocating key investments, and dealing with <strong>financial budgets</strong> and incomes. All of these tasks must be undertaken by the owner <strong>in person</strong>. Each of them requires his ability in a specific area. In a sense, <strong>running</strong> <strong>a business</strong> resembles receiving comprehensive education and testing. Much is learned and one’s competence is further tested. In fact, no matter whether the business finally succeeds or not, such experience will have brought about far-reaching benefits to a person’s life.</p>
<p>Secondly, the risks and difficulties encountered in the process of managing a business makes a person mentally strong. As is vastly acknowledged, every successful business leader possesses <strong>incredible</strong> willpower. But for their <strong>courage</strong> and belief in the face of obstacles, in no way can they make their business thrive and prosper. Undeniably, during the struggle toward profits and further development, each boss has to take risks and prepare for potential obstructions and challenges. From a certain perspective, the process of leading a business is equal to taking an <strong>adventure</strong>. Thus, only those who are <strong>fearless</strong> and persevering have a better chance to succeed. Cherishing this faith, most business owners would <strong>endeavor to</strong> cultivate their minds and <strong>steel</strong> their personalities.</p>
<p>Thirdly, it is also a great opportunity to realize individual values. To some extent, starting a business paves the way for one’s bigger contributions to society. For example, a new company can offer more jobs, thus enabling a number of <strong>unemployed</strong> people to earn a living. Meanwhile, with more businesses entering the market, consumers will be granted more choices. Tenser competition also helps step up economic prosperity. In addition, the government’s <strong>tax revenue</strong> will be enhanced as well.</p>
<p>As a consequence, regardless of all the risks one has to take while managing a business, I still believe it is a worthwhile endeavor. Even if there are failures or losses in the process, the experience itself would prove to be a huge treasure that makes a person’s life meaningful and valuable. Thus, if I were fortunate enough to <strong>afford</strong> a business, I would certainly devote myself wholeheartedly to it.</p>

<p>127．买房子，还是买企业？</p>
<p>如果手头有足够的钱，你会怎么花呢？毋庸置疑，人们对这个问题的反应不同，回答也各异。其中，购买一套房子和拥有一家企业是两个最常见的选择。这的确是个艰难的决定。而我情愿购买一家企业。</p>
<p>首先，企业提供了训练和考验一个人综合能力的宽广平台。毋庸置疑，企业经营者拥有参与各方面工作的自由权。例如，在作出重大决策和起草未来蓝图的过程中，经营者起着主导作用，同时，他／她还参与到雇用和培训新员工、监督工作质量、分配重点投资以及处理财务预算和营业收入等过程中。所有这些任务都必须由企业所有者亲自承担。每一个任务都要求他／她具备特定领域的能力。在某种意义上，经营一家企业就好比接受综合教育与测试。经营者从中可以学到很多东西，能力也会得到进一步的检验。其实，无论企业最终是否成功，这段经历都会使人的生活受益深远。</p>
<p>其次，管理企业过程中所遭遇的风险和困难使一个人在心理上更坚强。每位成功的企业领导者都拥有惊人的意志力，这是普遍公认的事实。如果没有面对艰难险阻时的勇气和信念，他们无论如何也不可能使企业蓬勃发展。不可否认，为了获得盈利并实现发展，每位老板都必须承担风险，并为潜在的困难和挑战作准备。从某个角度来看，领导一家企业的过程就如同进行一次探险。因此，只有那些毫无畏惧且坚持不懈的人才有更好的机会取得成功。抱着这种信念，大多数企业主都会努力塑造自己的思想、磨练自己的性格。</p>
<p>再次，经营企业也是实现个人价值的好机会。在某种程度上，创办企业可以为社会作出更大的贡献。例如，一家新公司会提供更多的工作岗位，从而使一些失业者得以谋生。与此同时，随着更多企业进入市场，消费者就拥有了更多选择。更激烈的竞争也有助于促进经济繁荣。此外，政府的税收收入也会增加。</p>
<p>因此，虽然管理企业时会承担很多风险，但我仍然相信这种尝试是值得的。即使在此过程中会出现失败或损失，但这段经历本身就是使人生有意义、有价值的珍宝。因此，如果我有幸负担得起一家企业，我必定会为它付出全心全意的努力。</p>

<h4 id="范文-28"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-28"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>Today, a number of college students choose to live <strong>off-campus</strong> by renting an apartment in a community. They may have their own reasons to justify this choice. However, in spite of the freedom and comfort gained from living outside the university, most students still prefer to live in dormitories. From my standpoint, dormitory life is more meaningful and suitable for students who are pursuing higher education.</p>
<p>First, <strong>group living</strong> in dormitories helps students learn how to relate well to others. Normally, at least 6 students are <strong>living under one roof</strong>. Thus, each <strong>roommate</strong> is required to play a part in creating and maintaining a harmonious atmosphere. In a sense, the dormitory is like a campus community which has its basic rules for everyone to obey. With the common goal of building a good environment for all, students will become far more <strong>self-conscious</strong> than before. They would try to carry on suitable communications among themselves. In the meantime, quarrels, arguments or even conflicts may be unavoidable. Whenever these situations occur, efforts should be made to find the best solutions <strong>so as to</strong> repair damaged relationships. As soon as the problems are solved, individuals involved may obtain more profound knowledge of techniques used in relating to others. As time goes by, students within such a circle may gradually comprehend the art of human relations.</p>
<p>Second, due to safety concerns, it is better to live on campus. Inside the university, all the dormitory buildings are installed with <strong>digital security surveillance</strong>, which ensures safer surroundings for students. In addition, safety administrators are also taking charge of these buildings <strong>in case</strong> dangers or other unexpected incidents take place. As a consequence, dormitories are a safe place to live. In contrast, it might be more <strong>risky</strong> for young students to live in communities outside campus. Unable to know their <strong>tenants</strong> and neighbors well, they are likely to be cheated by immoral individuals. Besides, if the place is not close to school, they will have to rush to the classes by taking busy public transportation. This certainly adds to the safety problem.</p>
<p>Third, living in the dormitory makes campus life more colorful. In most cases, students living off-campus would return to their houses when they finish all their lessons <strong>on a given day</strong>. Thereafter, they might miss many chances to take part in various activities held on campus in the evening. As for those who live in the dormitory, it is much easier to gain access to events or clubs after class. Without doubt, joining in such activities as often as possible instills endless happiness into an <strong>unforgettable</strong> university life.</p>
<p>In sum, <strong>residing in</strong> dormitories is more beneficial to college students. Only in this way can they fully experience the essences of university education. Besides, spending more time with schoolmates also teaches them the art of building good relationships with others. These are all helpful to their future careers. Thus, there is enough evidence to conclude that on-campus dormitories are a better residence for students.</p>

<p>128．住在大学宿舍还是社区公寓？</p>
<p>如今，一些大学生选择租住校外社区内的公寓。对此他们也许有自己充分的理由。然而，尽管住在校外能获得自由与舒适，但大部分学生仍然愿意住在宿舍里。在我看来，宿舍生活对高校学生来说更有意义，也更适合。</p>
<p>首先，宿合的群体生活有助于学生学会与他人很好地相处。通常情况下，至少有6个学生居住在同一个屋檐下。于是，每位室友都应承担起创造并维护和谐氛围的责任。在某种意义上，宿舍就好比一个校园社区，人人都应遵守基本准则。为了给所有人营造良好的环境，学生们会变得比从前更自觉。他们将努力维系彼此间恰当的沟通，与此同时，还会尽量避免争吵、争论甚至冲突的发生。每当出现这类状况时，室友们将试图寻找恢复被破坏的关系的最好方法。一旦问题得以解决，他们将获得有关交际技巧的更深刻知识。随着时间的流逝，生活在这个圈子里的学生将逐渐懂得为人处世之道。</p>
<p>其次，考虑到安全因素，在校园居住是更合适的。在大学里，所有的宿舍楼都安装了电子安全监控，这可以确保学生住所更加安全。此外，安全管理员负责监管宿舍楼以防止危险或其他意外事件的发生。因此，在宿舍居住是安全的。相比之下，在校外社区居住的年轻学生则可能面临更多风险。由于无法彻底了解租户和邻居，他们有可能被不道德的人欺骗。此外，如果公寓不在学校附近的话，他们还得乘坐繁忙的公共交通工具去上课。这无疑进一步增加了安全隐患。</p>
<p>再次，居住在宿舍使校园生活更加丰富多彩。在大多数情况下，在校外居住的学生在一天的课程结束之后就会返回公寓。因此，他们可能错过晚上校园里举行的各种活动。对于那些住在宿舍里的学生，他们可以更方便地参加课外活动或俱乐部。毫无疑问，多参与此类活动会给难忘的大学生涯注入无限快乐。</p>
<p>总之，在宿舍居住对大学生更有益。只有通过这种方式他们才能完全体会到大学教育的精髓。此外，花更多的时间与同学们相处也教给他们建立良好人际关系的艺术。这些对未来职业是有帮助的。因此，我们有充足理由相信，宿舍是学生更好的住所。</p>

<h4 id="范文-29"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-29"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>People’s daily life is <strong>intimately</strong> associated with the climate conditions of the place they inhabit. In some places, the weather remains the same throughout the year, without any distinct changes. There are also many places where the climate changes with the passage of time. Personally speaking, I would rather choose to reside in places with more diversified weather.</p>
<p>First of all, residents can experience different lifestyles owing to the diversity of climate. For example, in a place with four seasons, the climate normally changes four times a year. A typical way of living is adopted for each season. When the cold winter arrives, people may choose to spend more time <strong>indoors</strong> so as to enjoy the warm and comfortable atmosphere created by <strong>central heating</strong>. They usually get up later and try to get more sleep each day. As soon as spring begins, more outdoor activities take place, like going on <strong>spring outings</strong>, playing sports <strong>in the</strong> <strong>open air,</strong> planting flowers in the garden, and so on. In summer, as the daytime becomes longer and hotter, they may get up earlier in the morning and <strong>stay up</strong> later into the night. In autumn, <strong>the harvest time</strong> arrives. People begin to lead a busier life and store more food for the coming <strong>freezing</strong> winter.</p>
<p>In addition, each type of climate possesses unique attractions. To illustrate, during the cold season <strong>snowflakes</strong> can be seen falling <strong>elegantly</strong> from heaven, just like <strong>dancing angels</strong>. In a short while, the land, the trees and the buildings <strong>are all covered with</strong> pure whiteness. Stepping on the soft <strong>carpet</strong> of snow, people feel like they are entering a magical kingdom from fairytales. As the Chinese proverb says, “<strong>timely snow promises a year of</strong> <strong>harvest.</strong>” Indeed, <strong>blossoms of snow</strong> fill the world with <strong>astounding</strong> beauty and endless delight. The same is true with warm seasons. When spring arrives, the trees begin to <strong>burgeon</strong> and colorful flowers start to <strong>come out</strong>. In the bright sunshine, the green grassland is full of vigor and life. <strong>Picturesque</strong> scenes are witnessed everywhere. <strong>Drops</strong> of rain may also fall gently upon the earth, which add to the charms of this season. Some people have the traditional belief that spring rain is as precious as oil.</p>
<p>Moreover, living in places with different climates teaches people to adapt to changes. Admittedly, challenges from <strong>changeable</strong> weather truly exist. Instead of being ignorant to them, people ought to be reminded to be wellprepared. For example, in London, a city noted for its changeable weather, most <strong>pedestrians</strong> on the streets are carrying <strong>umbrellas</strong> with them. This good habit prevents them from getting wet in unexpected rains. Furthermore, during <strong>seasonal alternations</strong>, people are also motivated to <strong>take action</strong> in many respects, like changing clothes and having suitable diets. Such practice trains people to live under varied circumstances.</p>
<p>Consequently, experiencing the changes of weather and climate makes life more colorful and interesting. People are granted better opportunities to appreciate the diversified beauty of nature. Meanwhile, living in changeable climates also cultivates people’s ability to get accustomed to changes in life. These merits are combined to <strong>validate</strong> the point that it is better to live in places with changeable climates.</p>

<p>129．住在气候终年不变的地方，还是住在气候一年数变的地方？</p>
<p>人们的日常生活与其居住地的气候条件息息相关。在有些地方，天气常年保持平稳，没有任何明显的变化；而有些地方的气候随着时间的变化而变化。就个人而论，我更喜欢选择住在天气多变的地方。</p>
<p>首先，由于气候的多样性，居民可以体验不同的生活方式。例如，在四季分明的地方，一年之内通常有4次明显的气候变化。每个季节都给予人们独特的生活方式。当寒冬到来的时候，人们会选择花更多时间在室内享受中央供暖营造的温暖和舒适氛围，并且常常每天起床较晚以保证更多的睡眠。春天一到，他们会进行更多户外活动，如春游、户外体育锻炼、在花园中种花等。在夏天，由于白天持续时间更长，天气也更炎热，他们会在早上起得更早、在晚上睡得更晚。秋天是丰收的季节，人们开始更忙碌的生活，并为即将到来的严冬储存更多食物。</p>
<p>此外，每一种气候都拥有与众不同的魅力。比如，在寒冷的季节里，雪花优雅地从天宫飘落，如同飞舞的天使一般。一会儿工夫，地面、树梢和房顶上都铺满了一层纯净的洁白雪花。踏在松软如毯的雪上，人们感觉仿佛走进了童话中的奇妙王国。中国有句谚语，“瑞雪兆丰年。”的确，雪绒花为世界带来了惊人的美丽与无限的欢乐。温暖的季节也毫不逊色。当春天来临的时候，树木开始发芽，鲜艳的花朵含苞待放。在明亮的阳光里，翠绿的草地充满了生机与活力。如画的风景随处可见。有时，绵绵细雨也会温柔地滋润着大地，这更增添了春的曼妙。传统观念认为，春雨贵如油。</p>
<p>另外，在不同气候状况下生活的人们懂得如何适应变化。必须承认，来自多变天气的挑战的确存在。人们应该时刻提醒自己作好充分的准备，而不是对其视而不见。例如，在以天气多变著称的伦敦，街上很多行人都带着雨伞。这个好习惯使他们不至于在一场突然的降雨中淋湿。此外，在季节更替期间，人们也会在多方面采取行动，如更换衣服和调整饮食。这些实践训练人们适应不同生活环境的能力。</p>
<p>因此，体验天气和气候变化使人生更多彩、更有趣。人们有机会去欣赏大自然多样的美。与此同时，多变气候的生活也培养人们适应变化的能力。综合这些优点，我们不难得出结论：生活在气候多变的地方更好。</p>

<h4 id="范文-30"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-30"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>Numerous historical figures have won awe and respect from modern people. They are often regarded as models that set perfect examples for later generations. Indeed, the influences they have produced for human society can never <strong>fade away</strong> and their brilliant achievements are forever cherished in people’s minds. If I could travel back in time to meet one of them, I would choose Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>
<p>First of all, his strong character and shining spirit have won people’s hearts. Ever since the first time I read about him, I couldn’t help marveling at his outstanding personality. As a noted leader in the <strong>U.S. Civil Rights</strong> <strong>Movement</strong>, he played an indispensable role in promoting civil rights in America and all over the world. In 1964, King received the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions in eliminating <strong>racial segregation</strong> and <strong>racial</strong> <strong>discrimination</strong> through nonviolent means. Additionally, he also made unremitting efforts to end poverty and stop wars. Without doubt, this <strong>legendary personage</strong> has produced far-reaching influences on the human race. But for his iron determination and golden spirit, he could never have become such a respected international <strong>icon</strong>. I suppose many people cherish the dream to meet him in person and express the most heartfelt admiration for his character and his remarkable achievements.</p>
<p>Secondly, his <em>I have a dream</em> speech <strong>lives as</strong> an eternal symbol of his <strong>heroic</strong> life. It was during the 1963 March in Washington that King delivered this <strong>prominent</strong> speech. Before the Lincoln Memorial, he established his reputation as the most <strong>soul-inspiring</strong> speaker in the history of America. In 17 minutes, he extensively and <strong>passionately</strong> elaborated his sacred dream of equality, freedom and peace. Though speaking without a pre-written draft, he was extremely skillful in adopting the best words to provoke the emotions of everyone present. “I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character…” These sentences have been deeply rooted in people’s memories for a long time. No one can deny his <strong>unmatchable eloquence</strong>. If I were fortunate enough to have a face-to-face chat with him, I could learn many speaking techniques from him and I might become a better speaker in the future.</p>
<p>Finally, I would also wish to tell him about the situations in the world today. <strong>Justice</strong> and freedom have been widely spread, which is just what he always dreamt when he was alive. If he were told about the advancement of civil rights due to his efforts, he would definitely feel honored and satisfied. Meanwhile, problems like regional conflicts and wars still exist at present. King might offer constructive suggestions on solving such troubles. Thus, world peace could be better preserved.</p>
<p>As a giant hero in history, Martin Luther King, Jr., truly deserves our heartfelt tribute. Even today, his powerful remarks still <strong>echo</strong> in people’s hearts and minds. Although he has passed away, his spirit shall never <strong>perish</strong> and his sacrifices shall never have been made <strong>in vain</strong>. If I were given the chance to see him, I couldn’t wait to tell him that his sacred dream has come true.</p>

<p>130．你希望遇到历史上的哪位名人？</p>
<p>无数历史人物都赢得了现代人的敬畏之情。他们通常被视作为后人树立完美榜样的模范。的确，他们对人类社会产生的影响不会退却，那些辉煌的成就也将永久珍藏于人们的脑海中。如果我可以穿越时空与其中一位名人见面的话，我将选择马丁·路德·金。</p>
<p>首先，他那顽强的性格和光辉的精神赢得了人们的敬佩。自从我第一次读到他的时候，我禁不住对他杰出的性格感到惊叹。作为美国民权运动的杰出领袖之一，他在倡导美国和全世界民权的过程中起了不可替代的作用。由于金对非暴力方式消除种族隔离和种族歧视作出的贡献，他获得了1964年诺贝尔和平奖。此外，他还为结束贫困与停止战争做出了不懈的努力。毋庸置疑，这位传奇人物为全人类带来了深远的影响。如果没有他坚强的决心和黄金般的精神，他就不可能成为受全世界人民尊敬的偶像。想必很多人都怀有亲眼见到他的梦想，以借机抒发对他性格和惊人成就最真挚的崇敬之情。</p>
<p>第二，《我有一个梦想》的演说是他英雄人生中不朽的象征。金是在1963年华盛顿游行期间发表这篇著名演说的。在林肯纪念堂前，他成就了自己作为美国历史上最能鼓舞人心的演说家的美誉。在17分钟里，他全面且激情地描述了自己对平等、自由与和平的神圣梦想。尽管没有事先起草的文稿，他却巧妙地运用最恰当的言辞感染了所有在场的人。“我梦想有一天，我的4个孩子能在一个不是以他们的肤色，而是以他们的品格优劣来评价他们的国度里生活……”这些语句已经深深地刻在了人们心中。谁也不能否认他那无与伦比的口才。如果我有幸与他当面交谈，我就可以向他学习很多演说技巧，那样的话，我也有可能在未来成为更优秀的演讲者了。</p>
<p>最后，我希望告诉他当今的世界形势。公平与自由已得到广泛推崇，这正是他在世时最渴望看到的。如果他得知由于他的努力民权已得到提倡，他必定会感到荣耀与满足。同时，地区冲突和战争等问题仍然存在。金也许能提供解决这些争端的建设性意见。这样，世界和平将得到更好的维护。</p>
<p>作为历史上伟大的英雄，马丁·路德·金的确值得我们由衷地敬仰。直至今天，他那铿锵有力的言语仍然回荡于人们的心田。尽管他早已辞世，但他的精神永不磨灭，他所作出的牺牲也不会徒劳。如果我有机会与他见面，我将迫不及待地告诉他：他神圣的梦想已经实现了。</p>

<h4 id="范文-31"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-31"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>Nowadays, telephones and emails seem to be the most popular tools for people to communicate with one another. Through <strong>telephone lines</strong> or the Internet, messages can be sent back and forth with ease. Meanwhile, the fast-paced living style has reduced the <strong>frequency</strong> with which people have <strong>face-to-face conversations</strong>. Some people complain that communication between people has been made less personal. As far as I am concerned, these communication tools are not to blame.</p>
<p>Above all, friendship and love may be better delivered via telephone and email. We can easily imagine the possible embarrassment people may experience as they express <strong>inner feelings</strong> toward each other in face-to-face talks. In most cases, self-consciousness prevents them from revealing their <strong>internal selves</strong> directly and rashly. Careful consideration and more peaceful mental conditions are needed under such circumstances. As a matter of fact, making phone calls, sending short messages and delivering emails can be more suitable substitutes. Not much psychological pressure exists while using these communication tools. As a result, one’s heart can be revealed smoothly. Meanwhile, thanks to the assistance of advanced technology, telephone and cyber contacts have been made more vivid and <strong>personalized</strong>. For instance, <strong>thoughtfully-designed flashes</strong>, music and pictures can be attached to <strong>text-based</strong> messages. They surely make communication between close friends or between lovers more effective and personal.</p>
<p>Furthermore, convenience of mutual contacts also helps strengthen personal communication. The fast pace of life nowadays considerably reduces people’s chance to meet their friends. Therefore, in order to maintain efficient ties with them, it is a good idea to make fuller use of convenient communication tools. Needless to say, telephones and computers meet these requirements. With their help, <strong>greetings</strong> can be sent between friends as often as possible and in-depth chats or discussions can also be carried out frequently. In that case, both sides can feel that they are still <strong>being thought of</strong> by the other even if they are unable to get together in person for a while.</p>
<p>In fact, distances between people have been narrowed by telephones and the Internet. The world today is becoming smaller due to the <strong>prevalence</strong> of information technology. No matter where friends are, they can be <strong>reached</strong> at any time via telephone lines or cyber signals. From a certain perspective, they <strong>act as</strong> a bridge connecting people from around the globe. But for their irreplaceable functions, relationship between faraway friends would be much more difficult to keep.</p>
<p>In sum, it is extremely unfair to regard such useful means as a barrier that <strong>undermines</strong> personal communication. On the contrary, due to their advantageous features and the significant role they play in people’s lives, mutual ties are tremendously strengthened instead of being hindered. Therefore, in order to maintain better communication with others, people should be encouraged to make full use of telephones and emails.</p>

<p>131．电话和电子邮件使得人们之间的沟通缺少人情味儿了？</p>
<p>如今，电话和电子邮件似乎已成为最受人们欢迎的交流工具。通过电话线或互联网，消息就可以被轻松地来回传送。与此同时，快节奏的生活方式减少了人们当面交谈的频率。有些人抱怨说，人际交流已经变得不那么有人情味儿了。在我看来，这些通信工具并非罪魁祸首。</p>
<p>首先，通过电话和电子邮件，友谊与爱心可以得到更好的传递。我们很容易想象当面表达内心感情时的尴尬。在大多数情况下，自我意识会阻止人们以直接草率的方式流露自己的内心世界。此时需要的是谨慎的考虑和更平静的心态。这样，打电话、发短信、发邮件就比较适合。使用交流工具时不会存在过多的心理压力。于是，一个人的内心可以顺利地表达出来。与此同时，由于发达科技的辅助，电话和网络沟通变得更加生动与个性化。例如，精心设计的flash动画、音乐和图画都可附加在文字信息之上。它们无疑会使亲密朋友或恋人之间的沟通更有效，且更有人情味儿。</p>
<p>除此之外，方便的联络也有助于加强彼此沟通。当今生活的飞快节奏使朋友见面的机会变少了。因此，为了保持高效联系，就应该更充分利用方便的通讯工具。很显然，电话和电脑可以达到这些要求。有了它们的帮助，朋友间可以随时互传问候，深入的聊天或讨论也能经常展开。如此，即使无法聚在一起，他们都会感觉自己总被对方惦记着。</p>
<p>其实，人们之间的距离被电话和互联网拉近了。如今，由于信息技术的普及，世界变得越来越小。无论朋友身在何方，他们都可以通过电话线或网络信号随时联络到对方。从某个角度来看，通讯工具充当着连接全球各地的人们的桥梁。如果没有它们无懈可击的强大功能，相隔遥远的朋友就很难维系彼此的友谊。</p>
<p>总之，认为这些有用的沟通方式是破坏人际沟通的障碍是极其不公平的。相反，由于它们优越的特性以及在日常生活中重要的作用，人们之间的联络更加紧密了而不是受到阻碍。因此，为了保持彼此间更好的交流，人们应该充分利用电话和电子邮件。</p>

<h4 id="范文-32"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-32"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>With the higher degree of <strong>globalization</strong>, <strong>trans-national</strong> cooperation and communication have become more crucial than ever. For each qualified modern citizen, mastering a foreign language is <strong>more than</strong> a necessity, <strong>but</strong> <strong>rather</strong> a prerequisite ability. Nowadays, <strong>intensified</strong> emphasis has been laid upon foreign language education. An increasing number of primary schools begin to teach a foreign language in the very first <strong>semester</strong>. In my opinion, this is undoubtedly a beneficial practice.</p>
<p>In the first place, childhood is the best period for language learning. Research indicates that the brains of children are in a superior state to grasp the essences of a language. With a faster <strong>reaction speed</strong> and better memories, it can be much easier for them to assimilate basic <strong>grammatical points</strong> and remember new words and <strong>phrases</strong>. What’s more, children are extremely good at <strong>imitating</strong> others. Thus, by listening to <strong>recorded texts</strong>, they can follow the speaker in the <strong>tape</strong> and intimate the voice <strong>repeatedly</strong>. As time goes by, they will gradually speak what has been stored in their mind. As soon as they have accumulated enough <strong>vocabulary</strong> and expressions, they may use them bravely in spite of possible mistakes. These are all key elements that lead to progress in learning a language. Such a learning process is more effective in children than in adults.</p>
<p>In the second place, children are more easily interested in foreign languages and <strong>pick</strong> them <strong>up</strong> naturally at an early age. As is generally known, curiosity about new things is the <strong>inborn nature</strong> of any child. In their eyes, the world is full of mysteries that are waiting for them to <strong>explore</strong>. A new language is one such. Just as the famous saying goes, “Interest is the best teacher.” Inspired by passion, they may start to regard learning the language as a hobby. Reading interesting stories written in it, watching foreign <strong>cartoon videos</strong>, listening to songs by foreign singers, speaking and using it in daily life; all these are good habits in learning a language. If these habits can be kept persistently, these children will surely become excellent speakers in the future. My little sister is a perfect example. She picked up English as a hobby when she was only 7 years old. Since then, she has stuck to it with perseverance. Thanks to her marvelous English skills, she has <strong>been admitted to</strong> a famous university in the United States.</p>
<p>Last but not least, learning a foreign language may help children grasp their mother tongue. Without doubt, children are also fresh learners of their native language. All languages are inter-related and learning methods are mostly complementary to one another. The skills mastered while studying a foreign language may be <strong>dynamically</strong> adopted in the learning process of the mother language. Through the comparison between the two, children can notice their associations and essential differences. Thus, they are motivated to use both of these languages often and their speaking ability will be tremendously enhanced.</p>
<p>To conclude, children ought to learn a foreign language as soon as they enter school. The earlier they begin to understand and use a language, the more competent they will be. Thus, with an aim to train them to become <strong>eloquent</strong> speakers of different languages, educators should strive to provide the best language-learning environment for young students. <strong>In any case</strong>, having a good command of a foreign language is important for their future.</p>

<p>132．孩子是否应该一上学就开始学外语？</p>
<p>随着全球化程度的提高，跨国合作和交流已经比以往更加重要了。对于每位合格的现代公民来说，掌握一门外语不仅仅是一种需要，而更是一种必备的能力。如今，人们增强了对外语教育的重视，越来越多的小学在第一学期就开始教授外语。我认为这无疑是有益的实践。</p>
<p>首先，童年是语言学习的最佳时期。研究表明，儿童的大脑处于掌握语言精髓的优越状态。由于其更快的反应速度和更好的记忆力，孩子更容易吸收基本语法点、牢记新单词和词组。此外，他们还极其擅长模仿他人。于是，通过听课文录音，他们跟随磁带中的声音朗读，并反复模仿。随着时间的流逝，他们就可以逐渐说出头脑中储存的语言。一旦积累了足够的词汇和表达，他们就会勇敢地使用，即使可能犯错。这些都是取得语言学习进步的所有关键因素。比起成年人，这样的学习过程对儿童来说更有效。</p>
<p>其次，儿童更容易对外语产生兴趣，并且在很小的时候就自然地学会外语。众所周知，对新鲜事物的好奇是孩子的天性。在他们眼中，世界充满了等待着他们去探索的奥秘。一种新语言也包含其中。正如一句名言所述，“兴趣是最好的老师。”由于受到热情的鼓舞，他们开始把学习语言当做自己的爱好。阅读有趣的外语故事、观看外语卡通片、聆听外国歌曲并在日常生活中说外语、用外语，这些都是学习语言的好习惯。如果持之以恒，这些孩子在未来必定会成为优秀的外语人才。我的妹妹就是完美的榜样。她在7岁的时候就把学英语作为爱好，从那时起，她从未放弃。由于出色的英语能力，她已经被美国一所著名高校录取。</p>
<p>最后，学习外语有助于孩子掌握自己的母语。毫无疑问，儿童也是本国语言的初学者。所有的语言都是相互联系的，学习方法也大都是互补的。在学习外语中掌握的技巧也可以灵活地应用于母语的学习过程之中。通过对两者进行比较，孩子会注意它们之间的联系和根本区别。于是，他们会努力地经常使用两种语言，从而使语言能力显著提高。</p>
<p>总之，儿童应该在上学时就开始学习外语。越早听懂和使用一种语言，他们的能力就越强。因此，为了把他们训练成拥有不同语言才能的人，教育工作者应该努力为小学生提供最好的语言学习环境。无论如何，掌握一门外语对他们的未来至关重要。</p>

<h4 id="范文-33"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-33"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>Within the <strong>mighty</strong> forces of job hunters, there are two typical groups of candidates from which most employers select. One group encompasses inexperienced <strong>applicants</strong> who demand lower salaries, while the other is formed by experienced individuals who require higher salaries. If I were a boss searching for a satisfactory staff member, I would doubtlessly choose one who is rich in working experience regardless of their higher pay.</p>
<p>Above all, their working quality and efficiency is more <strong>readily</strong> ensured, thus promising more profits for the company. Normally, experienced workers are capable of handling difficult tasks as soon as they are employed. There is no need for them to <strong>undergo</strong> the complicated and <strong>long-term in-service training</strong>. Thus, much time and money may be saved. During the course of working, many mistakes or failures can be avoided because they have learned good lessons from past experience. <strong>Heightened</strong> cautiousness and focused attention would help them go through any problems <strong>handily</strong>. Meanwhile, the techniques and effective methods mastered before could also be adopted skillfully in similar projects whenever it is necessary. As a result, it might take a shorter time for them to complete a competitive duty smoothly and successfully. Needless to say, higher efficiency and superior quality are critical to any business. Supported by people with precious experience, a company leader has greater chances to increase <strong>revenues</strong> in the days to come.</p>
<p>In addition, higher pay serves as a tremendous impetus that encourages an employee to devote wholeheartedly to his work and his unit. If an excellent worker <strong>is dissatisfied with</strong> his salary, he might consider quitting the current job and working for competitors who offer better <strong>treatment</strong>. This would lead to unexpected losses. Psychologically speaking, higher salary denotes the acknowledgement of the employee’s individual values. Just like a powerful stimulus, it motivates him to struggle for bigger achievements. Only in this way can his competence be fully testified. In other words, he is trying to demonstrate the truth that he deserves what he receives. Thereafter, his idea of <strong>job-hopping</strong> might be forgotten and the possibility of <strong>brain drains</strong> diminishes for a company.</p>
<p>Finally, experienced workers may offer useful suggestions when the business leader is making important decisions. The prosperity and advancement of an enterprise can never be determined by the boss alone. Any talented <strong>staff member</strong> ought to play a part in decision-making. Instead of <strong>passively</strong> completing assigned tasks, experienced employees possess the ability to think creatively and work <strong>proactively</strong>. Their accumulated experience enables them to provide more reliable and valuable advice for a leader.</p>
<p>Briefly speaking, in order to enhance the pace of development, it is wise for the boss to hire an individual with richer working experience. The investment on his higher salary shall never have been made fruitlessly. <strong>On</strong> <strong>the contrary</strong>, it proves to be rewarding in the long run. By making good use of precious experience, he is sure to undertake the job more efficiently and make greater contributions.</p>

<p>133．雇用无经验低薪酬的员工还是有经验高薪酬的员工？</p>
<p>在求职大军中，大多数雇主会从两组典型的候选人中进行选择。一组包含没有经验但工资要求低的申请者，而另一组则由薪金要求高的有经验者构成。如果我是寻找理想职员的老板，我必定会选择拥有丰富工作经验的人，尽管他们的工资要求更高。</p>
<p>首先，他们的工作质量和效率更容易得到保证，从而为公司赢得更多利润。通常情况下，经验丰富的员工一入职就能肩负起艰难的任务。他们没有必要经受复杂、长期的在职培训。如此可以节省很多时间和金钱。由于他们已从过去的经历中总结了很好的经验，因此，在工作过程中可以避免很多错误和失败。高度的谨慎精神以及集中的注意力有助于问题得到顺利解决。与此同时，以前掌握的技术和有效方法也可以随时熟练地应用于类似的项目中，从而可以在更短的时间内顺利、成功地完成一项有难度的工作。不容置疑，高效率、高质量对任何企业都是至关重要的。在拥有宝贵经验的人士的支持下，企业领导者更有可能在不久的将来获得更高的营业收入。</p>
<p>此外，高工资可作为鼓励员工全心全意为工作和单位奉献的巨大推动力。如果一名出色的员工对自己的薪酬并不满意，他也许会考虑辞去现在的工作，并效力于提供更好待遇的对手企业。这势必导致意外的损失。从心理角度而言，更高的薪水意味着对员工个人价值的认可。犹如强力兴奋剂，它促使员工向更高的目标拼搏，因为只有这样他的实力才能得到充分的证明。换句话说，他试图证明自己的确“物有所值”，于是就会放弃“跳槽”的想法，而公司遭遇人才流失的可能性也随即消除。</p>
<p>最后，在企业领导者制定重要决策时，有经验的员工可以提供有用的建议。企业的繁荣与发展不可能只取决于老板一个人的力量。任何有才干的成员都应该参与决策制定的过程。经验丰富的雇员并非仅仅能被动地完成所分配的任务，他们还能够进行创造性思考并积极地工作。多年积累的经验使其有能力为领导者提供更可靠、更有价值的建议。</p>
<p>简而言之，为了加快发展的步伐，企业领导者雇用经验丰富的员工是明智之举。对其高薪水的投资不会是毫无收益的。恰恰相反，从长远来看这笔投资具有高回报率。通过充分利用以前的经验，员工必定能更有效地完成任务并作出更大的贡献。</p>

<h4 id="范文-34"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-34"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>Whenever games are mentioned, many people cannot help associating them with naveté. Without doubt, the love of play is part of the nature of innocent children. Nonetheless, the right to play games should not be their exclusive privilege. Owing to their varied population, adults also belong to the large group of the <strong>beneficiaries of</strong> <strong>games</strong>. Many kinds of games are designed specially for those who are no longer young. Indeed, it is reasonable to say that games can be as important for adults as they are for children.</p>
<p>First of all, playing games is an effective way to relax from daily pressure. Undeniably, the burdens on the shoulders of adults are becoming heavier nowadays. Among the numerous <strong>means</strong> to recover from tension, participating in colorful games <strong>stands out as</strong> a magical cure. The primary purpose of most games is to make people feel happy and relaxed. For instance, after a tedious day at work, white collar workers can take advantage of games to regain energy. At this moment, playing <strong>poker games</strong> might be a good choice. With the increasing popularity of different types of poker games among adults, we can easily sense their effectiveness in helping people relax. Besides, tiny <strong>flash games</strong> on the computer are fun to play. Such games make players forget about <strong>exhaustion</strong> and <strong>set</strong> their minds <strong>free</strong>. Of course, physical activities like basketball and soccer also play an important part in <strong>releasing</strong> people <strong>from</strong> pressure and keeping them healthy.</p>
<p>Moreover, some games might offer <strong>enlightening inspirations</strong> to adults and teach them good lessons. To illustrate, puzzle games motivate players to use their brains. During each <strong>attempt</strong> to find clues, players are urged to think from different angles. In such a process, they are likely to come up with creative ideas which can be adopted to solve practical problems in their work and life. Besides, there are also games that require numerous gamers to work together as a whole. While playing these, people can realize the significance of teamwork and mutual trust. Much can be learned from playing games.</p>
<p>Last but not least, playing games will make people feel younger. Endless joy can be gained from games. Just as an old Chinese saying goes, “A smile can make a person ten years younger.” Every adult ought to play as happily as <strong>innocent</strong> children. Games can also create a <strong>miraculous</strong> atmosphere that makes people feel as if they had travelled back in time to their childhoods. Many golden memories are <strong>recalled</strong> which can help people return to a <strong>worry-free</strong> state of mind.</p>
<p>As a consequence, adults have the right to play games <strong>to their hearts’ content</strong>. There is no need to be affected by the <strong>false impression</strong> that only children should enjoy the world of games. In fact, spending a portion of leisure time playing games is not merely a means to relax, but it can also help people in many other aspects. These merits justify the point that games are equally important for both children and adults.</p>

<p>134．游戏对成年人和儿童来说一样重要吗？</p>
<p>每当提及游戏时，很多人会禁不住将它们与“幼稚”联系起来。不可否认，爱玩是纯真儿童的天性。然而，玩游戏并非他们的专属特权。由于游戏拥有不同的对象群，成年人也属于游戏受益者的一部分。多种游戏专为成年人设计。的确，认为游戏对成年人和儿童来说一样重要是合理的。</p>
<p>首先，玩游戏是从日常压力中解脱出来的有效方式。不可否认，如今成年人肩上的负担变得更沉重了。在无数种恢复轻松状态的方法中，参加丰富多彩的游戏便是一剂神奇的妙方。大多数游戏的初衷就是使人们轻松快乐。例如，在结束了一天乏味的工作之后，白领职员可以利用游戏恢复活力。此时，打扑克也许是不错的选择。随着各种扑克游戏在成年人中越来越流行，我们能很容易感受到游戏在帮助人们放松方面的效果。此外，电脑动画小游戏也很有趣。这种游戏能使玩家放松精神、忘却疲劳。当然，诸如打篮球、踢足球之类的体育运动也能在帮助人们从压力中释放出来并保持健康方面发挥重要作用。</p>
<p>除此之外，有些游戏能给成年人提供启发式灵感，而且还具有教育意义。例如，猜谜游戏促使参与者开动脑筋。在找寻线索的每一次尝试中，人们必须从不同的角度思考。在这个过程中，他们有可能收获创造性的想法，这些想法可以应用于解决工作生活中的实际问题。另外，有的游戏要求众多玩家共同完成任务。在参与此类活动时，人们会意识到团队协作和相互信任的重要性。玩游戏时确实可以学到很多东西。</p>
<p>最后，玩游戏使人们感觉青春焕发。从游戏中可以获得无限的欢乐，中国有句古话，“笑一笑，十年少。”每个成年人都应该像天真的孩子一般开心地玩耍。游戏还能营造出一种奇妙的氛围，使人们感觉自己仿佛穿越时空回到了童年，并勾起很多美好的回忆，这可以帮助他们恢复到无忧无虑的状态。</p>
<p>因此，成年人有权尽情地玩游戏。“只有儿童才应该享受游戏的世界”，这是错误的印象，我们没必要受此错误印象的影响。其实，花一部分休闲时光玩游戏不仅能使人们放松下来，在其他很多方面也对人们有所帮助。这些优点证明：游戏对于儿童和成年人来说同等重要。</p>

<h4 id="范文-35"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-35"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>Thanks to the devoted care and <strong>selfless</strong> love from parents, we are able to grow up happily and safely. No one else in the world can be as dear as them. Thus, it is a must for each individual to try to become a high-quality son or daughter. In my culture, being <strong>obedient, grateful</strong> and responsible are the most typical qualities possessed by good sons and daughters. They have been passed down from generation to generation as treasures. Even today, they still remain the same.</p>
<p>First, in the eyes of many parents, obedience is the most essential quality possessed by a good son or daughter. Just as the old Chinese saying goes, “<strong>If you don’t take the elders’ advice, you will suffer</strong> <strong>losses</strong>.” Indeed, children are obliged to listen to their parents. This is where the essence of obedience lies. At early stages of life, people should always <strong>follow the guidance of</strong> their parents due to their innocence and immaturity. Under no circumstance should they <strong>go against the will of</strong> their elders. When they finally enter adulthood, their parents’ suggestions are still valuable and ought to be seriously taken into account. Even though sometimes their ideas may not be correct, direct <strong>confrontations</strong> should be avoided. In fact, being obedient is a most typical way to describe a good son or daughter.</p>
<p>Second, a good son or daughter should always be thankful to those who have brought him up. Undoubtedly, children are the biggest beneficiaries from parents. Without their painstaking efforts and <strong>affectionate</strong> care, it is impossible for any individual to grow up to be happy and healthy. In spite of the fact that people can never <strong>repay</strong> what parents have devoted to them, heartfelt gratitude should always stay in a child’s heart and soul. The quality of being grateful is found in every good son or daughter. It motivates him or her to work diligently toward success. Only in this way can true feelings of gratitude be fully demonstrated. Personal achievements act as the biggest reward to thank parents. Anyway, &quot;<strong>actions speak louder than words.</strong>”</p>
<p>Third, being responsible constitutes another major quality in a good son or daughter. As children grow up, their parents are getting older and weaker, but still deserve a better-ensured life after retirement. Thus, for quality children, it is a basic obligation to take good care of their parents and offer financial support. Meanwhile, spending enough time with them and never letting them feel lonely are also some <strong>inherent</strong> duties of good sons and daughters.</p>
<p>By and large, these fundamental qualities have been well preserved and passed down through the years. Indeed, they are all good traditions that should remain the same regardless of changing times. As a result, we ought to bear them deeply in mind and try to <strong>establish ourselves as</strong> obedient, grateful and responsible sons and daughters.</p>

<p>135．好儿子或好女儿需具备哪些重要素质？</p>
<p>多亏了父母体贴的关怀和无私的爱，我们才能幸福平安地成长。世界上没有其他人能比父母更可亲可近了。因此，每个人都必须努力成为好女儿或好儿子。在我的文化中，孝顺、感恩和责任感是优秀儿女具备的最典型素质。它们犹如珍宝，已被世代传承。直至今天，依旧保持不变。</p>
<p>首先，在很多父母眼中，孝顺是优秀儿女具备的最根本素质。中国有句古话，“不听老人言，吃亏在眼前。”的确，孩子有义务听父母的话，这就是孝顺的精髓所在。小时候，出于幼稚与不成熟，孩子应该始终听从父母的教导。在任何情况下他们都不应违背长辈的意愿。在他们最终成年以后，父母的建议依旧有价值，理应得到慎重考虑。尽管有时他们的想法并不正确，也应该避免直接的对抗。其实，“孝顺”是对优秀儿女最典型的描述。</p>
<p>第二，好儿女应该对抚养自己长大的父母始终怀有感恩之心。毋庸置疑，孩子从父母那里得到的最多。若没有父母辛勤的努力和深情的关怀，任何人都不可能快乐健康地成长。尽管人们无法偿还父母所有的付出，但真挚的感激之情应该永远停留于内心深处。每位好儿女都是心存感恩的。这驱使他们为成功而奋力拼搏。只有这样，真情才能得以充分证明。个人成就是对父母最大的感恩回报。无论如何，“行动胜于言辞。”</p>
<p>第三，责任感是造就好儿女的另一个主要品质。孩子长大了，父母也变老、变虚弱了。然而即使退休了，他们仍理应过上更加安逸的日子。因此，对于好孩子来说，精心照顾父母并给予经济补助是他们的基本义务。与此同时，花足够的时间与父母共处以防止他们感到孤独，这也是好儿女应尽的职责。</p>
<p>总而言之，这么多年这些基本素质都得到了很好的保持与传承。的确，无论时代如何变迁，它们都应是长久不变的优秀传统。因此，我们应该将其铭刻于心，并努力使自己成为孝顺、感恩和有责任感的儿女。</p>

<p>In most cases, the <strong>biological clock</strong> remarkably affects people’s living habits. As a person gets used to a routine daily schedule, it is uneasy to change it. Thus, before selecting the most suitable time to <strong>rise</strong> and to sleep, careful considerations have to be made. The physical and spiritual conditions differ among individuals and everyone may have his own choice. Some people are early risers, while others would like to get up late and stay up into the night. Personally, I prefer to get up early in the morning.</p>
<p>To begin with, it is a healthy habit to rise early each day. According to medical studies, the human body is in a superior state early in the morning, especially after doing physical exercise. With refreshed energy and mental power, people can perform better at work. Meanwhile, job performance is also superior to that of the night. Many doctors have emphasized that the most suitable time to go to sleep is after 11 pm. If human brains are still undertaking heavy tasks at that time, people are facing higher risks of health problems including <strong>mental</strong> <strong>breakdowns, insomnia, amnesia</strong> and so forth. Furthermore, no matter what type of job one does, working late at night will cause excessive tiredness. Thus, people might suffer from headaches and <strong>dizziness</strong> after getting up the next day.</p>
<p>Furthermore, people will miss the best moment of the whole day if they get up too late. “It is the early bird that catches the worm.” At <strong>daybreak</strong> the sky is <strong>brightened</strong>. The very first <strong>rays of sunshine</strong> fall upon the earth and the entire city is bathed in fresh morning air. Everything is filled with life and vigor. Needless to say, only those who get up early can witness such a fantastic scene. Thus, they can begin a new day’s work with lifted spirits and restored energy. By contrast, it is impossible for late risers to fully sense the greatness of morning.</p>
<p>Besides, “<strong>burning the midnight oil</strong>” may interrupt others. If a person shares an apartment with other people, his habit of staying up late in the night will prevent his roommates from sleeping well. Even though he might try to <strong>keep silent</strong> while working, his electric light may still bother those who are <strong>desperately</strong> in need of a good sleeping atmosphere. Thus, there might be complaints from them, which considerably undermines the harmony inside a house. Anyhow, it is important to maintain good relationships between people who share the same space.</p>
<p>In brief, although people may have their special reasons to stay up, I would still remind the midnight oil-burners of the possible side effects incurred by their habit. Indeed, no one is able to work nonstop like machines in the night without feeling tired. Some potential harm might be done to their health. Thus, in order to stay healthy and be <strong>energetic</strong> enough while working, it is a better choice to breathe fresh air in the early morning every day.</p>

<p>136．你喜欢早起还是晚起？</p>
<p>在大多数情况下，生物钟可以极大地影响人们的生活习惯。当一个人适应了某种常规日程表时，习惯就很难改变。因此，在选择最适合的作息时间之前有必要进行认真的考虑。人们的生理和精神状况各不相同，每个人都有自己的选择。有些人习惯早起，而有些人则起床很晚，且喜欢熬夜。就我个人而言，我更偏向早起。</p>
<p>首先，每天早起是一个健康的好习惯。据医学研究证实，人体在清晨处于较好的状态，尤其是在体育锻炼之后。有了充沛的能量和精神，人们就能在工作中表现得更好。与此同时，早晨的工作表现也优于夜晚。很多医生都强调，晚上11点以后是最佳的睡眠时间。如果人脑在那时仍然承受着繁重的任务，人们就会面临产生健康问题的更高风险，包括神经衰弱、失眠、健忘等。此外，一个人无论从事何种工作，熬夜都会导致过度疲劳。于是，起床时就可能感到头痛或眩晕。</p>
<p>此外，如果起床过晚，人们就将错过一天里的最佳时刻。“早起的鸟儿有虫吃。”黎明破晓之际，清晨的第一缕阳光照射在地球上，整个城市沐浴在清新的空气之中。世间万物都充满了生机与活力。不言而喻，只有早起的人们才能目睹如此奇妙的景象。于是，他们能够以振奋的精神和充足的精力开始新一天的工作。相比之下，晚起的人们无法充分感受到清晨的美好。</p>
<p>此外，熬夜会打扰别人。如果一个人与他人同住一间公寓，熬夜工作的习惯也许会让室友无法安然入睡。即使在工作时尽量默不作声，但灯光仍然会干扰迫切需要良好睡眠氛围的人们。于是，抱怨就可能产生，这将极大损害居所的和谐。无论如何，维系室友间的友好关系是很重要的。</p>
<p>简言之，尽管人们会有熬夜的特殊原因，我仍然要提醒“夜猫子”们注意这个习惯可能产生的不良影响。的确，没有人能像机器一般不知疲倦地在夜间持续劳作。这会给他们的健康带来潜在危害。因此，为了保持健康，并在工作时精力旺盛，每天早起呼吸新鲜空气是更好的选择。</p>

<h4 id="范文-37"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-37"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>Nowadays, traveling has become a most fashionable choice for many <strong>holidaymakers</strong>. When asked about the way they travel, each individual may express his own preferences. Some would like to have a companion during the journey, saying it is safer and more enjoyable to be with a friend, while others would rather travel alone and as freely as possible. From my standpoint, I am more in favor of <strong>the former</strong>.</p>
<p>Firstly, due to safety concerns, it is better to have a reliable person by one’s side when traveling in unfamiliar places. To illustrate, <strong>tempted by</strong> the desire for gain, some evil locals might cheat <strong>unguarded</strong> tourists of money. Among the <strong>victims</strong>, most are traveling alone. Companions, on the other hand, are able to give cautious reminders to each other all the time. With mutual protection, the possibility of <strong>falling into traps</strong> diminishes. Besides, during a long journey, there might be unexpected happenings or even emergencies. For instance, a traveler may suddenly fall ill. At this critical moment, a partner would be of great help. He could take his sick friend to the hospital without any delay and take good care of him until he recovers. But for the assistance from a companion, travelers would be exposed to more dangers on the way.</p>
<p>Secondly, traveling expenditures may be cut down and much money can be saved. Regarding the <strong>accommodation</strong> on the journey, companions can share a <strong>double room</strong> in a hotel. Thus, each of them only has to pay half of the room price. The same is true with eating. It is a most popular choice for travelers to <strong>go dutch</strong> when having meals in restaurants. In this way, not only can they enjoy more dishes, but they can also spend less money than people who <strong>dine</strong> alone. In addition, on the trip, there might be the necessity to rent vehicles. Likewise, transportation costs can be shared equally between them as well.</p>
<p>Last but not least, being with a friend will make the traveling experience more joyful and interesting. I suppose many people might agree with the notion that happiness is to be shared rather than <strong>kept to oneself</strong>. For example, when beautiful <strong>sights present themselves</strong>, partners can take photos for each other to their hearts’ content. Thus, unforgettable moments have been recorded both in the cameras and in their minds. Meanwhile, they can also have enjoyable chats, play entertaining games and tell funny stories to each other. These all add to the pleasure of a trip.</p>
<p>In sum, having a partner during a trip is more advantageous than being totally alone. Those who travel alone may face more risks and troubles in the process. “Two heads are better than one.” Friends can take care of each other whenever unexpected situations occur. Thus, in order to enjoy a worry-free trip, it is better to travel with a companion.</p>

<p>137．单独旅行还是结伴旅行？</p>
<p>如今，旅行已经成为众多度假者中最时尚的选择。每当问及出游方式时，每个人都会表达出自己的喜好。有的人喜欢在旅途中与旅伴同行，认为这样会更安全、更有乐趣；而有的人则情愿独自旅行，尽享自由。从我的立场来看，我更支持前者。</p>
<p>首先，出于对安全的考虑，在陌生地方游玩时最好能有一个可靠的人陪在身边。具体来讲，因受利益驱使，一些邪恶的当地人可能会从毫无防备的旅客那里骗取钱财。受骗者中大部分都是独自旅行者。相比之下，同伴就能时刻给予彼此谨慎的提醒。有了互相保护，落入陷阱的可能性便可降低。此外，在漫长旅途中，也可能发生意外或紧急情况。例如，一名游客可能突然病倒。在此关键时刻，同伴可以提供很大的帮助。他会立即把生病的朋友送往医院，并精心照顾他直至康复。如果没有同伴的协助，旅行者在途中会面临更多危险。</p>
<p>其次，结伴出行可降低旅行费用，从而节省很多钱。对于旅行期间的住宿，旅伴们可以合住旅馆的双人间。如此，每个人只需支付一半的房费。用餐方面也是如此。餐馆就餐AA制最受旅友们欢迎。这样，他们不仅可以享受更多美食，还比单独就餐花钱更少。此外，在旅途中也有租车的必要。车费同样也可以分摊。</p>
<p>最后，与朋友在一起使旅途更快乐、更有趣。想必很多人都赞同一点，那就是，幸福是要分享的，而不是独享的。例如，当眼前出现绚丽美景时，同伴们可以尽情地给彼此拍照留念。于是，难忘的时光不仅被相机记录，也深深铭刻在他们的脑海中。与此同时，他们还可以开心地聊天、玩有趣的游戏以及给对方讲笑话。这些都为旅行增添了欢乐。</p>
<p>总之，结伴旅行比独自旅行更有优势。单独出游的人们在途中也许会面临更多的风险和麻烦。“人多智广。”每当意外状况发生时，朋友可以互相照顾。因此，为了享受无忧无虑的旅行，最好能与旅伴同行。</p>

<h4 id="范文-38"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-38"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>The motto “Never, never give up” is frequently <strong>quoted</strong> whenever a person <strong>embarks on</strong> an endeavor. Though simple in words, it helps one maintain courage in the face of difficulties and inspires him to continue with his efforts persistently. According to some explanations, this expression means to keep trying and never stop working toward a goal. Personally speaking, I agree with this idea.</p>
<p>To begin with, one should never give up any attempts to conquer obstacles in the way of reaching a goal. In other words, it is a must to keep trying before successes and solutions are found. That is the <strong>central meaning</strong> of this expression. By no means can those who surrender to temporary failures or difficulties obtain final success. In fact, such a strong spirit has kept many notable figures company throughout their lifetimes. For instance, if Thomas Edison had given up his experiments after his numerous <strong>trials</strong> and <strong>setbacks</strong>, he would never have succeeded in inventing so many useful devices for human beings. Therefore, the courage to keep trying is a key quality that brings a person closer to his ideal.</p>
<p>Second, as long as a goal has been set, one ought to stick to it and never give up. To some extent, working without a target is like <strong>voyaging</strong> on the ocean without a <strong>beacon</strong>. By following goals, people are not easily lost. Thus, when a person is setting a goal, he has to understand its <strong>paramount</strong> importance <strong>in context</strong>. Once it has been set, there is no excuse for him to <strong>abandon</strong> it. Instead, he should lock it firmly in his heart. If the goal is remembered, there is always hope to reach it. Thus, no matter how difficult it might be to attain, one should never give up a good goal.</p>
<p>Actually, this expression can apply in other varied situations. In sport, <strong>cheerleading teams</strong> often shout out these words, or express this idea, to encourage the <strong>participants</strong> to keep working and competing <strong>courageously</strong>. In the classroom, when a student has failed an exam, a teacher may <strong>cheer</strong> him <strong>up</strong> by expressing this sentiment. Thus, a student might go on studying hard so as to succeed in a future exam. At the office, when an employee has not completed his tasks and becomes depressed, his colleagues might use this expression to motivate him to continue in his efforts. Afterwards, much of his confidence can be regained.</p>
<p>Consequently, in order to reach success, one should repeatedly remind himself not to give up under any circumstance. Without doubt, this motto “never, never give up” provides an endless source of willpower. It urges people to struggle for the final goal with unremitting efforts and iron determination. After all, &quot;<strong>he who laughs last</strong> <strong>laughs best</strong>.”</p>

<p>138．我们是否需要****“<strong><strong>永不，永不放弃</strong></strong>”****？</p>
<p>每当人们为目标开始拼搏的时候，“永不放弃”这句座右铭时常被提及。尽管言语简单，它却能帮助一个人在困难面前保持勇敢，并继续坚持不懈地努力。这句话有一种解释：持续奋斗，永不停息。就个人而论，我同意这种说法。</p>
<p>首先，在实现目标的过程中，不应放弃任何克服艰难险阻的尝试。也就是说，在获得成功和解决方案之前必须持续努力。这句座右铭的中心思想就在于此。向暂时的失败和困难妥协的人是无论如何也不可能实现最终胜利的。其实，这种伟大的精神伴随很多名人的一生。例如，倘若托马斯·爱迪生在屡次磨难和挫折之后放弃了试验，那么，他就无法成就那么多对人类有用的发明了。因此，继续努力的勇气是使一个人接近理想的关键品质。</p>
<p>第二，只要目标已经树立，就应该坚持此目标，永不放弃。在某种程度上，没有目标地工作就好比在没有灯塔的大海上航行。跟随着目标，人们就不易迷路。因此，当一个人明确了目标，就必须明白其中蕴含的极端重要性。一旦目标确定，就没有任何理由放弃，而是要将其紧锁于心。只要心怀目标，就总有成功的希望。因此，无论有多么艰难，一个人都不应该放弃美好的目标。</p>
<p>其实，这句话适用于各种场合。体育比赛时，拉拉队经常呼喊这句话或表达这种意思以鼓励选手们继续勇敢地拼搏。在教室里，当一名学生考试没通过，老师会用这句话来鼓励他。于是，学生就会继续努力学习，争取在以后的考试中得到好成绩。在办公室里，当一位职员因未能完成自己的任务而变得消沉时，他的同事可以用这句话鼓舞他继续奋斗。随后，他也许能重拾自信。</p>
<p>因此，若想取得成功，就必须反复提醒自己在任何情况下都不要放弃。毫无疑问，“永不放弃”这句座右铭是意志力的无尽源泉。它敦促人们用不懈的努力和钢铁般的决心为最终目标而奋斗。毕竟，“笑到最后的才是最好的。”</p>

<h4 id="范文-39"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-39"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>Looking back to my school years, our <strong>headmaster</strong> always encouraged us to study hard and make progress day by day. Without doubt, if one refuses to march ahead, he is likely to lag behind. It must be a commonly-cherished aim for all to make progress because no one desires to be behind. Nevertheless, some side effects of progress have shown up in many aspects of our daily life. From some perspectives, progress is not always good.</p>
<p>First, progress in industries has become a major contributor to pollution problems. With a higher degree of industrialization, an increasing number of factories are being built. Those factories established near <strong>heavilypopulated areas</strong> might release industrial waste into <strong>waterways</strong> in the area. As a consequence, that water can be seriously polluted. What’s worse, some of the pollutants can be <strong>poisonous</strong>. Meanwhile, industrial gases are released into the air from factory <strong>chimneys</strong>. Thus, the air can also be severely polluted. Such potential hazards can threaten the health of residents and disturb the ecological balance in <strong>affected areas</strong>. There have been many news reports about nuclear power stations polluting water and air and causing fatal illnesses.</p>
<p>In addition, some social progress has forced modern citizens to live under overwhelming pressure. Admittedly, a fast pace of life has become a feature of modern society. Most working people face unprecedented <strong>workplace</strong> challenges and competition. Additionally, in the face of rising housing and fuel prices and other daily necessities, many people have no other way but to work day and night. Seldom can they afford enough time to totally relax. Many have to give up much time that should be spent with their families. This is a huge sacrifice. Needless to say, heavy burdens <strong>imposed</strong> by social progress have deprived many people of the ability to enjoy life.</p>
<p>The progress of information technology has also posed many problems. To illustrate, the prevalence of the Internet has <strong>given rise to</strong> the spread of online rumors, which considerably undermines social security and stability. Frequent cyber crimes have roused negative public attention, and result in diversified frauds and network hacking attacks. Without doubt, these are doing great harm to the normal interests of ordinary citizens.</p>
<p>To conclude, everything in the world is double-sided and progress is no exception. In spite of the fact that progress has brought numerous benefits to most people, we should never neglect to consider its negative impacts and <strong>act to mitigate</strong> them.</p>

<p>139．进步总是好事吗？</p>
<p>回首学生时代，校长总是鼓励我们要“好好学习，天天向上”。毋庸置疑，如果一个人拒绝前进，他就有可能落后。没有人希望自己落后，所以大家都应有取得进步的共同目标。然而，在我们日常生活的很多方面，进步的副作用也显现了。从某些角度来看，进步并不总是好的。</p>
<p>首先，工业进步已经成为导致污染问题的主要因素。随着工业化程度的提高，越来越多的工厂被建立起来。那些建于人口聚居区附近的工厂可能将工业废物排入此地区的水道。因此，当地水质可能遭到严重污染。更糟糕的是，有些污染物含有毒素。与此同时，工业废气从工厂的烟囱中排入空气，导致严重的空气污染。这些潜在的危害威胁着居民的健康，并且破坏了该受污染地区的生态平衡。有关核电站污染水和空气并引发致命疾病的事件已频频被新闻曝光。</p>
<p>此外，某些社会进步迫使现代居民生活在难以抗拒的压力之下。不可否认，快节奏的生活是现代社会的特征。大多数劳动者面临着空前的职场挑战和竞争。另外，在飞涨的房价、油价和其他生活必需品价格面前，很多人别无选择，只能夜以继日地工作。他们很少有充足时间完全放松身心，而且还得放弃与家人共处的时间。这的确是很大的牺牲。毋庸置疑，社会进步带来的沉重负担已经夺走了很多人享受生活的能力。</p>
<p>信息技术的进步也带来了很多问题。例如，互联网的普及引发了网络谣言的泛滥，这极大地损害了社会安全与稳定。频繁的网络犯罪在公众中也产生了消极影响，并导致多种形式的诈骗和网络黑客攻击。不容置疑，这些都对普通百姓的根本利益造成巨大危害。</p>
<p>总之，世间万物都具有两面性，进步也不例外。尽管进步使大多数人受益，但我们不应忽视其负面影响，应该采取行动去缓解这些影响。</p>

<h4 id="范文-40"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-40"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>Under the powerful assistance of various transportation vehicles, humans are more able to travel to faraway places. Whenever there is a necessity to <strong>travel any distance</strong>, a number of choices are available. Without doubt, the invention of these modes of transport has brought about great changes to human life. Among those popular vehicles, airplanes have been the most <strong>influential</strong>.</p>
<p>The world has been made smaller by airplanes. Compared with other vehicles, airplanes are able to cover greater distances in less time. Ancient people may have had to consume several days or even weeks traveling <strong>by slower means</strong> before arriving at a faraway destination. As a result, our ancestors had very few opportunities to travel to different parts of their country, and world travel was <strong>unthinkable</strong>. Not everyone was as fortunate as the great traveler <strong>Marco Polo</strong>. Today, passengers can visit several distant cities within a single day. An increasing number of modern citizens have realized dreams to travel around the globe, and have done so by airplane.</p>
<p>Furthermore, much time is saved by taking an airplane <strong>flight</strong>, especially when <strong>conducting business</strong>. For instance, it only takes three or four hours to travel from Beijing to the southern part of China by air, whereas over one day is required to do the same by train. Suppose a businessman has to attend meetings being held in two cities which are far away from each other over a short period of time; the best way is to travel by airplane. Otherwise, he might be unable to make both meetings.</p>
<p>In addition, superior <strong>amenities</strong> make an airplane journey safer and more comfortable. Supported by advanced technology and comprehensive security systems, airplanes are commonly recognized as the safest means of transportation. Statistics indicate that airplanes have the lowest chances of <strong>traffic accidents.</strong> Quality of service is also high since all crew members have undergone strict training before going on duty. The smiling faces of flight <strong>attendants</strong> make the passengers <strong>feel at home</strong>. During the journey, a variety of drinks and snack foods are served, and on long flights meals are provided. Sometimes, the crew may even give each passenger a little <strong>souvenir</strong>, enhancing passengers’ <strong>perception</strong> of good service.</p>
<p>Thanks to airplanes, passengers can have pleasant <strong>airborne</strong> traveling experiences. For some, a long-kept dream to fly can come true. Meanwhile, the incredible speed of flying in airplanes has dramatically narrowed the distances between different parts of the world. Compared with other modes of transportation, airplanes have indeed changed people’s life to the largest extent.</p>

<p>140．一种改变人类生活的交通工具</p>
<p>在各种交通工具的有力协助之下，人们的出行能力增强了。每当（人们）要出远门时，有很多方法可供选择。毋庸置疑，交通工具的发明给人们的生活带来了巨变。其中，飞机的影响最明显。</p>
<p>飞机使世界变得更小了。与其他交通工具相比，飞机可以用更短的时间跨越更远的距离。在借助缓慢工具的情况下，古代人也许得花几天甚至几周时间才能抵达远方的目的地。于是，他们很少有机会走遍全国，周游世界更是难以想象。并非人人都和伟大的旅行者马可·波罗一样幸运。如今，乘客可以在短短一天之内走访几个远方的城市。越来越多的现代人已经实现了游遍全球的梦想，而这归功于飞机。</p>
<p>其次，乘坐飞机可以节省很多时间，尤其在出差的时候。例如，从北京乘航班飞往南方只需要3到4小时，而坐火车则需要24小时以上。假设一位商人必须在短时间内去相隔较远的两座城市开会，那么坐飞机是最佳途径，否则，他也许无法两个会议都赶上了。</p>
<p>此外，完善的设施使航空旅行更安全、更舒适。由于发达科技和全面安全系统的支持，飞机被公认为安全系数最高的交通工具。据统计显示，飞机的事故发生率最低。服务质量也很高，因为所有的乘务人员在入职之前都经过了严格的培训。空中乘务员微笑的面容使乘客宾至如归。在旅途中，他们提供各种饮料和零食，长途飞行时还安排了正餐。有时，乘务人员还会送给每位乘客一个小礼物，使他们更深地感受到其优质的服务。</p>
<p>多亏有了飞机，旅客才能够享受愉快的航空之旅。对于某些人来说，长久以来的飞行之梦得以实现。与此同时，飞机航行的惊人速度戏剧般地缩短了世界各地之间的距离。与其他交通方式相比，飞机的确最大程度地改变了人们的生活。</p>

<h4 id="范文-41"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-41"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>Attending live events or performances has become a popular trend for many audiences and among an event’s passionate fans. In spite of expensive <strong>entrance tickets</strong>, many are willing to immerse themselves in the atmosphere in person. They regard this as an enjoyable experience. Frankly speaking, I do not agree with them: watching the same events on TV is a better choice.</p>
<p>First of all, a large crowd present at an event makes the environment too noisy to bear. I once attended a live concert held by a famous singer in a city <strong>stadium</strong>. A group of fans who travelled all the way from another city was seated right behind me. They appeared to be so crazy about their <strong>idol</strong> that whenever this star began to sing, they went all out to <strong>scream out</strong> his name, and became excited to tears. Thus, other members of the audience and I were unable to hear a word. Our ears were also suffering from other noises around us. Since then, I have not been to any live performances. By contrast, the environment at home is much more peaceful and comfortable. With a cup of tea in my hand, I can enjoy the performance on TV to my heart’s content.</p>
<p>In addition to potential unbearable noise, attendance at live events presents other problems. Long distances between the audience and the stage also prevent most people from seeing a performance clearly. Needless to say, not everyone is lucky enough to sit in <strong>front-row seats</strong>. Most of these best positions have been reserved by wealthy people in advance. Take the football match for example: due to the large size of the <strong>pitch</strong>, it is impossible for most fans seated in <strong>upper</strong> seats to see the players and action clearly. Such a problem never occurs if one watches a <strong>broadcast</strong> of a match on television. <strong>Video cameras</strong> are able to record every important detail during the match, including the <strong>facial expressions</strong> of the players. In the meantime, <strong>sports commentators</strong> also help audiences fully understand and enjoy the match.</p>
<p>Moreover, open-air stadiums may present unexpected weather conditions. In severe cases, performances or sporting events may have to be canceled or delayed. Thus, an audience may have wasted time traveling, or may choose to stay and endure <strong>adverse weather</strong>. As for those who leave, a strong sense of regret might negatively affect them, because they have been unable to enjoy the event. Without doubt, these types of occurrences are unable to severely affect audiences comfortably seated before their televisions.</p>
<p>In sum, even though the atmosphere of live events can fill audiences with excitement, not everyone is used to the <strong>accompanying</strong> noise. What’s worse, distracted by a huge crowd of noisy fans, it is impossible to enjoy the performances with concentrated attention. Therefore, considering all the unfavorable points in attending live events, I would rather stay at home and watch them on television.</p>

<p>141．现场表演和电视转播哪个更精彩？</p>
<p>观看现场比赛或演出已经成为众多观众和狂热爱好者追赶的潮流。尽管票价昂贵，很多人还是愿意亲身感受现场气氛，他们认为这种经历是令人愉快的。坦率地讲，我并不赞同。我认为，在电视上看直播是更好的选择。</p>
<p>首先，大群观众的出席使现场四周的噪音难以忍受。我曾经去市体育馆参加了一次某著名歌星的现场演唱会。一群从其他城市赶来的歌迷正好坐在我后面。他们似乎对偶像非常疯狂，每当歌星开口唱歌，他们就拼命尖叫出他的名字，并激动地泪流满面。包括我在内的其他观众根本听不到一句歌手的演唱。我们的耳朵还经受着周围其他噪音的折磨。从那时起，我再也没有观看过现场演出了。相比之下，家中的环境更安静、更舒适。手捧一杯清茶，我可以尽情地欣赏电视直播。</p>
<p>除了可能令人无法忍受的噪音，观看现场演出还存在其他问题。观众与舞台距离很远，这使大部分人无法看清楚表演。不必说，并非所有人都能幸运地坐在前排。大部分最佳位置已经提前被富人们预订一空了。以足球比赛为例，由于足球场的庞大，大多数坐在上方的球迷不可能清楚地看到球员和他们的动作。如果看电视直播的话，这个问题就不会出现。摄像机能够记录比赛过程中的每一个重要细节，包括队员的面部表情。与此同时，体育解说员也能帮助观众全面地理解和欣赏比赛。</p>
<p>此外，露天体育馆可能遭遇意外天气状况。严重时，表演或体育比赛就得被取消或推迟。于是，观众可能白白浪费了来回奔波的时间，也可能留在原地承受极端天气。对于那些中途离开的人来说，一种强烈的后悔情绪油然而生，因为他们未能完整地欣赏演出。毫无疑问，此类状况不会严重影响那些舒适地坐在电视机前的观众。</p>
<p>总之，尽管现场赛事使观众激动兴奋，然而并非每个人都能适应伴随的噪音。更糟糕的是，由于嘈杂呼喊声的干扰，人们无法集中注意力欣赏演出。因此，考虑到上述所有观看现场表演的缺点，我宁可在家里看电视直播。</p>

<h4 id="范文-42"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-42"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>Another construction plan has been announced by the local government, saying that a new high school may be built in my community. As soon as I heard the inspiring news, I couldn’t help feeling delighted and grateful. Without doubt, the establishment of a new high school will bring about many benefits to our community. Such a decision ought to <strong>win support from</strong> our town’s <strong>residents</strong>.</p>
<p>To begin with, building a new school will benefit the students in the community. There might be a number of them whose schools are not near their neighborhoods, and have to spend much time traveling to and from school every day. They may also need to get up early to <strong>catch a bus</strong>, while others may choose to go to school by bike. Obviously, their safety may be challenged by heavy rush hour traffic. If a new high school is built near their homes, much of these students’ time and energy can be saved. They could concentrate more on their studies, and their parents will no longer worry about their safety during travel.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with a new school being constructed the overall local education level will be improved. As a matter of fact, competition among schools can motivate other schools to improve their own teaching services <strong>for</strong> <strong>fear of</strong> challenges to their enrollment levels and revenue. <strong>In conjunction</strong>, students are endowed with more choices. They are truly entitled to select their most desired schools and compete for enrollment.</p>
<p>Students will not be the only beneficiaries of a new school. Many job opportunities will be provided for the local citizens. From a certain perspective, the new school can help solve an unemployment problem in the city. As soon as construction work is started, there will be a demand for construction workers, <strong>architects</strong>, designers and engineers. When the whole project has been successfully completed, a large variety of <strong>job</strong> <strong>vacancies</strong> may also become available, including the teaching staff, <strong>administrative and logistical personnel</strong> as well as a <strong>security force</strong>. Additionally, if the school <strong>expands</strong> in the future it will continue to bring benefits to the local economy.</p>
<p>In brief, the government ought to spare no effort to raise the general education level of our community. Building more schools constitutes an effective approach to reach this goal. Therefore, it is quite worthwhile to construct a new high school in our community. As long as the teaching quality is ensured and the <strong>school facilities</strong> are <strong>up to standard</strong>, it will certainly be a benefit to our town.</p>

<p>142．你赞成在你的社区建一所新的高中吗？</p>
<p>地方政府宣布了另一项建设计划，声称我们社区可能会建起一所新的中学。一得知此振奋人心的消息，我禁不住感到欣慰与感激。毫无疑问，一所新中学的建立将给我们社区带来很多好处。这个决定应该赢得居民的支持。</p>
<p>首先，建立一所新学校会使社区里的学生受益。有些学生的学校也许不在附近，他们每天都得在上下学路上花很多时间。有的学生需要早起赶公交车，而有的会选择骑自行车。很显然，高峰时段拥堵的车流会给他们的安全带来隐患。如果一所新中学在他们的家附近建立起来，这些学生便可节省很多时间和精力，从而更专注于学习。他们的父母也不必再担心上学途中的安全问题了。</p>
<p>此外，一所新学校的建设有助于提高当地整体教育水平。实际上，学校间的竞争促使其他学校改善教学质量，他们唯恐新学校会给自己的招生人数和收入带来挑战。同时，学生会有更多的选择。他们的确有权选择最理想的学校，并为录取名额竞争。</p>
<p>学生并非新学校的唯一受益群。这所新学校还将为当地居民提供很多工作机会。从某个角度来看，新学校有助于解决城市的失业问题。一旦建设工程展开，就需要招聘建筑工人、建筑师、设计师和工程师。当整个项目成功竣工的时候，又有一大批职位空缺，包括教职工、行政和后勤人员以及保安队伍。此外，如果学校未来扩建的话，它还有助于推动当地经济。</p>
<p>简言之，政府应该不遗余力地提高我们社区的整体教育水平。建设更多的学校就是达到此目标的有效途径之一。因此，在我们社区建设一所新中学是非常值得的。只要教学质量得以保证，且学校设施达到合格标准，它必将对我们的城市有益。</p>

<h4 id="范文-43"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-43"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>Undeniably, not everything in the world complies with people’s expectations all the time. Faced with this reality, people sometimes have to accept it and <strong>negotiate undesired pathways</strong> unwillingly. Each individual of society should try to become less self-centered. In this way, people will be more able to deal with things in which they have no interest.</p>
<p>First, in order <strong>to earn a living</strong>, people may be engaged in a profession they are not actually passionate about. The highly-competitive job market and sometimes overwhelming life pressure urges many college graduates to give up their passions and choose to work in another field. Sometimes these fields <strong>have nothing to do with</strong> their personal preferences, but instead may offer ampler pay and more welfare benefits, or have better <strong>prospects</strong> for future development. These are all <strong>essential elements</strong> that should be given top priority by the individual, especially ones who lack working experience. In fact, society is full of many such examples: my friend Kate studied mathematics in university. After graduation, she found it extremely difficult to get a satisfactory job related to her university major. She was finally forced to change her <strong>career orientation</strong>.</p>
<p>Second, with the purpose of maintaining health, people may adopt some habits they may not enjoy. To illustrate, those who are overweight receive <strong>recommendations</strong> to diet and participate in various physical activities in order to avoid higher risks of heart diseases. Although these suggestions are contradictory to the likes of some people, they still should accept them <strong>without reserve</strong>. In the past, they might enjoy eating many kinds of foods which are high in sugar and fat; however, in order to lose weight, they have no other choice but to give them up and begin to eat healthy food, including fruit and vegetables. They may not have interest in doing sports before, but ought to cultivate this habit and <strong>stick to</strong> it for their health.</p>
<p>Third, when there are some emergent tasks, people have to give up their leisure time to settle them. Suppose an <strong>office clerk</strong> is spending time with his family in the park over a weekend when suddenly his cell phone rings. The call is from his boss who asks him to attend an important meeting immediately. Thus, he has to rush back to the office without delay and take care of the issue. Needless to say, an enjoyable moment has been interrupted and after all, work comes first, no matter how unwilling a person may be.</p>
<p>In sum, although it might be painstaking for people to do things they dislike, they still ought to deal with them carefully and responsibly. Only in this way can some <strong>realistic</strong> problems be solved. Judging from all the abovementioned situations, we may reach the conclusion that sometimes people should be encouraged to do things they may not enjoy doing.</p>

<p>143．人们有时应该做自己不喜欢做的事情吗？</p>
<p>不可否认，世界上并非所有的事都能始终符合人们的心意。在这个现实面前，人们有时必须接受它，并且走自己不情愿走的路。社会中的每个人都应该尽量不要以自我为中心。这样，人们将更有能力应对自己不感兴趣的事情。</p>
<p>首先，为了谋生，人们可能从事他们并不真正热衷的职业。竞争激烈的人才市场以及有时难以抗拒的生活压力迫使很多大学毕业生放弃自己的兴趣、选择在另一个领域工作。这些领域有时与他们的个人偏好无关，但能提供更丰厚的薪酬和更多的福利，或拥有更好的发展前景。尤其对于缺乏工作经验的人来说，这些都是应给予头等关注的必需的要素。其实，社会上有很多这样的例子。我的朋友凯特在大学里专攻数学。毕业以后，她发现很难找到与自己大学专业相关的理想工作。最终，她不得不改变了职业方向。</p>
<p>第二，为了保持健康，人们也许得养成自己并不喜欢的习惯。比如，体重超标的人将接受有关节食和参加多种体育运动的建议，从而避免患心脏病的更高风险。尽管这些建议与他们的喜好相悖，他们仍然应该毫无保留地接受。他们过去可能喜欢吃各种高糖分、高脂肪的食物。然而，为了减肥，他们必须放弃这些美食，并开始摄入蔬菜、水果之类的健康食品；他们以前也许对体育锻炼不感兴趣，但是，为了健康，他们也必须养成这个习惯并坚持下去。</p>
<p>第三，当紧急任务出现时，人们也必须放弃休息时间去应对。假设在某个周末，一位办公室职员正在与家人畅游公园，突然手机响了，是老板让他立即去参加一个重要的会议。于是，他不得不马上赶回办公室处理此事。很显然，愉快的时光被打扰了。毕竟，工作优先，无论他有多么不情愿。</p>
<p>总之，虽然做自己不喜欢做的事是艰苦的，但人们仍然应该认真负责地对待。只有这样才能解决某些现实的问题。综上所述，我们可以得出如此结论：有时候人们应该做自己并不喜欢做的事情。</p>

<h4 id="范文-44"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-44"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>I have just received an email from my former classmate at college telling me that she plans to move to my city. <strong>Delighted by</strong> the good news, <strong>I couldn’t help telling</strong> her a great deal about this city in my reply. Indeed, she ought to be well prepared before arriving here. With this purpose in mind, I have tried to <strong>figure</strong> <strong>out</strong> her preferences and thought of things to tell her about living in this place. Hopefully these ideas can be useful references for her.</p>
<p>First of all, its prosperous commercial atmosphere might be appealing to my friend, who is a <strong>passionate</strong> <strong>shopper</strong>. The <strong>downtown area</strong> is made up of several <strong>grand-scale</strong> shopping districts. Wandering on the streets there, people can visit numerous interesting stores with unique characteristics. Shopping there can be an enjoyable experience for her. During weekends, shops selling <strong>overseas brand-name products</strong>, fashionable clothing, books and other <strong>specialties</strong> offer <strong>sharp discounts</strong>. Customers are able to <strong>make good purchases</strong> at more reasonable prices. There are also many supermarkets situated in different parts of the city. Thus, local citizens do not have to travel far to <strong>shop for</strong> daily necessities. In a word, this place is a <strong>paradise for shopping</strong>.</p>
<p>Secondly, citizens are blessed with more job opportunities in my city. Its huge <strong>market potential</strong> has attracted many international investors to establish companies and branches here. With the construction of an advanced <strong>economic development zone</strong>, an increasing number of enterprises have formed here. Among them, many are multi-national corporations which boast better working facilities and superior employee welfare. Obviously, they have a high demand for talented workers who are qualified to <strong>fill their positions</strong>. Facing so many opportunities, my friend would have no difficulty in finding a satisfactory position.</p>
<p>However, I have to remind my friend of some cruel realities she is going to face. The traffic jams during rush hours constitutes a major problem for anyone who works in this city. On weekdays, people can be stuck in long queues of waiting cars and buses on the major streets. As a result, much time can be wasted in the early morning or late afternoon. Meanwhile, because of the release of industrial gases, air pollution has become another hazard to local citizens. Dirty air poses a threat to people’s health.</p>
<p>Therefore, nothing can ever be totally satisfactory. Wherever people choose to live, merits and defects coexist. As long as some essential knowledge is gained <strong>beforehand</strong>, it is easier for <strong>new arrivals</strong> to find and grow accustomed to a new place. By presenting all the favorable points and negative conditions about this city, I believe my friend will adapt to the change of this living environment soon.</p>

<p>144．我的城市的优点与缺点</p>
<p>我刚刚收到以前大学同学寄来的一封电子邮件，邮件中说她计划搬到我所在的城市居住。听到这个令人开心的消息，我在回信中禁不住告诉她很多有关这座城市的事。在到来之前，她的确应该作充分的准备。鉴于此，我试图推断出她的喜好，并向她描述了生活在这座城市里的情况。但愿这些参考信息能对她有用。</p>
<p>首先，繁荣的商业氛围也许对我的朋友颇具吸引力，因为她是一位狂热的购物者。市中心由几个大型购物区组成。徜徉于那里的街道，人们可以光顾无数有趣的特色店铺。在此处购物定会是她愉快的经历。周末期间，销售海外名牌产品、时尚服装、图书和其他特产的商店会大幅度打折，顾客可以以更合理的价格购买到满意的商品。此外，超市遍及城市的各个角落，因而，当地居民不必走很远购买日常必需品。简言之，这里是购物的天堂。</p>
<p>其次，市民拥有较多的工作机会。这座城市巨大的市场潜力已经吸引了很多国际投资者在此开设公司和分支机构。随着一座高级经济开发区的落成，越来越多的企业在这里成立。其中许多是提供优越工作设施和员工福利的跨国公司。很显然，他们对能胜任其职位的人才需求量很大。在如此多的机会面前，我的朋友会很轻松地找到自己理想的工作。</p>
<p>然而，我必须提醒我的朋友关注一些她将面对的残酷事实。高峰时段的交通堵塞是所有工作于此的人遭遇的主要问题之一。在工作日，人们可能被困在大街上那些等待车辆排成的长队里。于是，清晨和傍晚的很多时间都被浪费了。与此同时，由于工业废气的排放，空气污染已经成为本地市民的另一个危害，污浊的空气威胁着人们的健康。</p>
<p>因此，世间万物皆不完美。无论人们选择住在哪里，优点和缺点共存。只要提前对新地方有了基本的了解，新来者会更容易适应。通过对这座城市优点与不足的所有描述，我相信我的朋友会很快适应新的居住环境。</p>

<h4 id="范文-45"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#范文-45"></a> 范文</h4>
<p>According to <strong>data analyses released</strong> by the United Nations, the average life span of the world’s population has been <strong>prolonged</strong> in recent years. In other words, people are living longer than before. When considering the <strong>major causes</strong> of this phenomenon, we may find some clues in current global situation and in our daily lives. From my standpoint, world peace, enhanced living standards and advanced medicine are three of the most important reasons.</p>
<p>At present, people from most countries are living in peace. With the improvement of <strong>multilateral relations</strong> among different nations, the chances of another world war have become <strong>slimmer</strong> than ever. Despite occasional conflicts in some regions, general trends indicate that the world today has become more and more harmonious. Global attention has <strong>been diverted from</strong> fighting in wars to developing national and international economies. Tracing back to the time of wars, many ordinary citizens lost their lives at an early age. It was extremely difficult for people to live long in security. By contrast, people now do not have to live in danger. The higher degree of peace enables people to live longer.</p>
<p>Secondly, global living standards have been considerably enhanced, which provide superior conditions for people to live longer. Thanks to ample supplies of food and other daily necessities, most modern citizens do not have to suffer from <strong>starvation</strong> and cold weather like their ancestors. In addition to material enjoyment, people are also endowed with more spiritual comfort nowadays, which is an indicator of quality life. Diversified means of recreation have dramatically improved people’s state of mind. From a certain angle, staying in a happy mood is an effective way to stay healthy.</p>
<p>Last but not least, people have benefited tremendously from the advancement of modern medicine. In the past, <strong>running a fever</strong> or having a cough were considered serious problems. In order to recover, patients had to see a doctor or else their lives might be <strong>at stake</strong>. Today, these common illnesses can be cured easily by <strong>taking pills</strong>, often without a <strong>doctor’s prescription</strong>. Furthermore, owing to constant breakthroughs in medical research, diseases which used to be <strong>incurable</strong> are now treated successfully. Meanwhile, with advanced technical support, the chances of successful <strong>surgical operations</strong> have become higher. In other words, more lives are being saved by advanced medicine. This is another main contributor to people’s longer lifespan.</p>
<p>Human beings are blessed with more agreeable conditions that allow them to live better than before. <strong>In</strong> <strong>addition to</strong> the comparatively more peaceful social environment, the unprecedented advancements in economy and medicine also play a critical role in improving quality of life. Judging from all these points, we may see why people are living longer now.</p>

<p>145．现代人长寿的原因</p>
<p>联合国发布的数据分析显示，世界人口的平均寿命近年来呈延长趋势。换句话说，人们现在活得更长了。论及导致此现象的主因，我们可以从当前全球形势和日常生活中找到线索。在我看来，世界和平、生活水平的提高以及发达的医学是三个最重要的原因。</p>
<p>如今，大多数国家的人民都生活在和平环境里。随着多国间关系的改善，爆发另一次世界大战的概率比任何时候都低。尽管偶尔会发生地区冲突，但整体趋势表明世界变得越来越和谐了。全球焦点已从战争转向发展国内与国际的经济。回首战争年代，很多普通百姓都在年少时丧命。人们很难安全地活到高龄。相比之下，今天的人们不再生活在水深火热之中。更高程度的和平使人们活得更长久。</p>
<p>第二点，全球生活水平已得到极大程度的提高，这为延长人们的寿命提供了优越的条件。由于食物及其他日常必需品的充足供应，大多数现代人不必再像前人一样遭受饥饿和寒冷的折磨了。除了物质享受以外，如今的人们也拥有更多精神享受，这正是优质生活的体现。各种娱乐形式极大地改善了人们的心态。从某个角度来看，心态快乐是保持健康的有效途径。</p>
<p>最后，现代医学的发展也使人类获益匪浅。过去，发烧或咳嗽都被认为是严重的问题。为了康复，病人必须去看医生，否则他们的生命就危在旦夕。如今，这些普通的病症只需吃药便可轻松治愈，通常无需医生的处方。此外，由于医学研究不断取得突破，过去无法医治的绝症如今可以得到成功治疗。与此同时，由于先进技术的支持，外科手术的成功率也大幅度提高。换句话说，发达医学正在挽救更多的生命。这是人们寿命变长的另一个主要原因。</p>
<p>人类拥有了比从前更有利的长寿条件。除了相对比较和平的社会环境之外，经济和医学的空前发展也在改善生活质量方面起了关键作用。从这些要点我们可以看出为什么如今人们的寿命更长了。</p>
