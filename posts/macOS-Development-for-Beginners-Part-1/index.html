<p>Do you want to learn how to develop your own apps for macOS?</p>
<p>Good news! Apple makes developing for macOS incredibly easy, and in this tutorial series you’ll learn how. You’ll learn how to create your first app for macOS — even if you’re a complete beginner.</p>
<ul>
<li>In this first part you’ll first learn about how to obtain the tools you need to develop for macOS. Then, while creating a simple “Hello, World!” app, you’ll take a tour of Xcode, discovering how to run an app, edit code, design the UI and debug your code.</li>
<li>In Parts 2 &amp; 3 of this series, you’ll create a more complex Egg Timer app and learn about the components that make up a macOS app, from how an app starts, to constructing the UI, all the way to handling user interaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what are you waiting for? The world of desktop apps awaits!</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Here’s some guidance of where to begin with this series:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are new to Swift, this series assumes some Swift knowledge, so first check out our <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/category/swift" target="_blank" rel="external">Swift tutorials</a> to get a great introduction.</li>
<li>If you already have iOS experience, this first part of the series will be a review. Take a quick look through the topics to make sure and then skip straight ahead to the next part of the series.</li>
<li>Otherwise, keep reading. This series is for complete beginners – no experience of developing for iOS or macOS is required!</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="getting-started"> Getting Started</span></h2>
<p>To become a macOS developer, you will need two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>A Mac running macOS Sierra: The macOS operating system only runs on Apple computers, so you need a Mac both to develop and run macOS apps.</li>
<li>Xcode: This is the IDE used to create macOS apps. You’ll learn how to install this later in this section.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you’ve built your app, if you want to upload it to the App Store for distribution, you’ll also need to pay for an Apple developer account. But this is not a requirement until you are ready to send your app out to the world, and even then, only if you want to distribute through the Mac App Store. If you already have a developer account for distributing iOS apps, then you are all set – Apple has merged the developer accounts so that you only need a single account to distribute apps for any Apple devices.</p>
<p>Unlike some other platforms, developing for macOS requires the installation of just one tool: Xcode. Xcode is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that includes everything you need to develop macOS, iOS, watchOS and tvOS apps.</p>
<p>If you don’t have Xcode already, click on the Apple icon in the upper left of your menu and select <em>App Store…</em> to open the Mac App Store. You will need an App Store account to download Xcode even though Xcode is free.</p>
<p><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/01/AppStore.png" alt="AppStore"></p>
<p>Search for Xcode and click the <em>Install</em> button to start the download. Once it has downloaded and installed (which may take a while – it is quite large) open it from your <em>Applications</em>folder. The first time you run Xcode, and after every major update, it will ask you for permission to install additional components. Enter your password and allow Xcode to install these components.</p>
<p><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/01/GetXcode.png" alt="GetXcode"></p>
<h2><span id="hello-world"> Hello World!</span></h2>
<p>Following the long-standing tradition when learning a new programming language or platform, you are going to start by creating a Hello World! app for macOS.</p>
<p>Open Xcode if it is not already running. You should see a Welcome to Xcode window – if you don’t see it, choose <em>Welcome to Xcode</em> from the <em>Window</em> menu.</p>
<p><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/01/Welcome.png" alt="Welcome"></p>
<p>Click <em>Create a new Xcode project</em> and when the next dialog appears, choose <em>macOS</em> from the tabs across the top. Select <em>Cocoa Application</em> from inside the <em>Application</em> section and click <em>Next</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/01/Template.png" alt="Template"></p>
<p>Give your new app a name – <em>HelloWorld</em> – make sure that the language is set to <em>Swift</em> and that <em>Use Storyboards</em> is checked. Uncheck all the other options.</p>
<p><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/01/Options.png" alt="Options"></p>
<p>Click <em>Next</em> and <em>Create</em> to save your new app project.</p>
<h2><span id="running-your-app"> Running Your App</span></h2>
<p>Xcode has created the basic template for your app with all the required files. At this stage, it is fun to run the app and see how much you get for free.</p>
<p>Click the <em>Play</em> button in the toolbar to run the app or use the <em>Command-R</em> shortcut. Xcode will now compile all of the code into machine code, bundle up the resources required by the app and then execute it.</p>
<p><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/01/Run.png" alt="Run"></p>
<p><em>Note:</em> The first time you ever build and run an app in Xcode, you might be asked whether you want to <em>Enable Developer Mode on this Mac</em>. You’re safe to select <em>Enable</em>, at which point you may have to enter your password. Developer mode allows Xcode to attach a debugger to running processes – which will be extremely useful when building your application!</p>
<p>You should now see a blank window but don’t be disappointed – have a look at what you can already do:</p>
<ul>
<li>The window is resizable, it can be minimized and made full screen.</li>
<li>There is a complete set of menus, many of which already work without you doing anything.</li>
<li>The Dock icon has the usual menus.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/01/FirstRun.png" alt="FirstRun"></p>
<p>But now it’s time for you to make the display a bit more interesting, so quit the app and go back to Xcode.</p>
<h2><span id="the-xcode-interface"> The Xcode Interface</span></h2>
<p>Xcode packs a lot of features into a small package, so not everything is visible at one time. To be an efficient Xcode user, you need to know where everything is — and how to get to it.</p>
<p>When you open a new project in Xcode, you have a window with a toolbar and three main panels.</p>
<p><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/01/Xcode1.png" alt="Xcode1"></p>
<p>The left panel is the <em>Navigator</em> panel and has 8 display options across the top. The one you will mostly use is the first one – <em>Project</em> – which lists all the files in your project and allows you to click on any one to edit it.</p>
<p>The center panel is the <em>Editor</em> panel and will display whatever you have selected from the <em>Project Navigator</em>.</p>
<p>The right panel is the <em>Utilities</em> panel and it will vary depending on what you are looking at in the <em>Editor</em> panel.</p>
<h2><span id="adding-the-ui"> Adding the UI</span></h2>
<p>You design the user interface using a Storyboard. Your app already has a storyboard, so go to the <em>Project Navigator</em> and click on <em>Main.storyboard</em> to show it in the Editor panel.</p>
<p>Your display has just changed dramatically! In the Editor panel, you can now see the Document Outline and the visual editor for the UI.</p>
<p>Have a look at the things you can see in the visual editor. There are three main areas, each of which also has a textual representation in the Document Outline:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Application Scene</em>: The menu bar and items.</li>
<li><em>Window Controller Scene</em>: Configures how the window will behave.</li>
<li><em>View Controller Scene</em>: Where your UI elements will go.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the <em>Utilities</em> panel, you see a top section with 8 tabs and a bottom section with 4 tabs.</p>
<p>The bottom section switches between various things you can insert into your project. Right now you want to insert UI elements, so select the <em>Object library</em> which is the third from the left.</p>
<p>In the filter at the bottom, type “text” to reduce the number of choices, and drag a <em>Text Field</em> into your <em>View Controller Scene</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/01/Xcode2.png" alt="Xcode2"></p>
<p>Now filter for “button” and drag a <em>Push Button</em> into the <em>View Controller Scene</em>. Finally, add a <em>Label</em>.</p>
<p>Now, build and run the app using the <em>Play</em> button or <em>Command-R</em>. You will see these 3 UI elements. Try typing in the text field – it already supports all the standard editing shortcuts: copy, paste, cut, select all, undo, redo and so on. But the button does nothing, and the label just shows “Label”, so it is time to make things more interactive.</p>
<p><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/01/Run2.png" alt="Run2"></p>
<h2><span id="configuring-the-ui"> Configuring the UI</span></h2>
<p>Go back to <em>Main.storyboard</em> and click on the button to select it. In the <em>Utilities</em> panel on the right, make sure the <em>Attributes Inspector</em> is showing – the 4th button across the top.</p>
<p>Change the title of the button to “Say Hello”. The button may not be wide enough to show all the text, so go to the <em>Editor</em> menu and select <em>Size to Fit Content</em> which should fix that. (If Size to Fit Content is disabled, click somewhere to de-select the button, then re-select it and try again.)</p>
<p><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/01/Button.png" alt="Button"></p>
<p>Now click in the text field to select it. For this app, the user is going to type their name in here, and when they click the button, the app will show “Hello name-goes-here!” in the label. To help the users, add some placeholder text to the text field using the <em>Attributes Inspector</em>.</p>
<p>Stretch the text field out a bit to allow for long names and position the button to the right of it. When dragging objects around in the <em>View Controller Scene</em>, blue lines will appear to help you align and position the objects based on Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines.</p>
<p><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/01/TextField.png" alt="TextField"></p>
<p>Position the label below the text field and button. Since the label is going to be important, make it use a larger font. Select the label and in the <em>Attributes Inspector</em>, change the font to <em>System Regular 30</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/01/FontSize.png" alt="FontSize"></p>
<p>How about making the text red to add even more excitement?</p>
<p><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/01/Color.png" alt="Color"></p>
<p>You can’t tell how long a name a user might enter, so resize the field to fit the height of that font and to almost fill the width of the window.</p>
<p>Build &amp; run the app to check that your UI changes have taken effect. Once you are happy with the look of the text in the label, delete the label’s <em>Title</em> so that the label starts off empty.</p>
<p><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/01/RunWithUI.png" alt="RunWithUI"></p>
<h2><span id="connecting-the-ui-to-the-code"> Connecting the UI to the code</span></h2>
<p>Your app still doesn’t do what you want, but in order for that to work, you need to start adding code and that code has to be able to communicate with the UI. To make those linkages, you are going to use Xcode’s <em>Assistant Editor</em>. With the <em>Main.storyboard</em> visible, option-click on <em>ViewController.swift</em> in the <em>Project Navigator</em>. This will create a second editor panel containing the ViewController code.</p>
<p>Depending on the size of your monitor, things may be looking a bit cramped now, so use the rightmost button in the Toolbar to hide the Utilities. If you need even more space, hide the Navigator.</p>
<p><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/01/Assistant.png" alt="Assistant"></p>
<p>Select the text field. Hold down the Control key and drag from the text field into the top of the <code>ViewController</code> class definition. Let go and enter <code>nameField</code> in the name box of the popup, then click <em>Connect</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/01/AddOutlet.png" alt="AddOutlet"></p>
<p>Do the same with the label, naming it <code>helloLabel</code>.</p>
<p>Looking at the code that Xcode has generated, you see that these are both marked with <code>@IBOutlet</code>. This is short for Interface Builder Outlet and is how you tell the storyboard editor that these object names are available for linking to a visual object.</p>
<p>For the button, the code does not need to have a name for it, but it does need to know when a user clicks the button. This calls for an <code>@IBAction</code> instead of an <code>@IBOutlet</code>.</p>
<p>Select the button and Control-Drag into <em>ViewController.swift</em> as before. This time, change the <em>Connection</em>popup to <em>Action</em> and set the name to <code>sayButtonClicked</code>. This creates the function that will be called when the button is clicked.</p>
<p><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/01/AddAction.png" alt="AddAction"></p>
<p>Everything is now in place to edit the code. Close the <em>Assistant Editor</em> using the X in the top right corner and switch to <em>ViewController.swift</em>. If you had hidden the <em>Navigator</em>, click the toggle button in the top right, or press <em>Command-1</em> to jump directly to the <em>Project Navigator</em>.</p>
<p>Enter the following code into <code>sayButtonClicked</code>.</p>
<figure class="highlight swift"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> name = nameField.stringValue</div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> name.isEmpty &#123;</div><div class="line">  name = <span class="string">"World"</span></div><div class="line">&#125;</div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">let</span> greeting = <span class="string">"Hello <span class="subst">\(name)</span>!"</span></div><div class="line">helloLabel.stringValue = greeting</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The complete code in <em>ViewController.swift</em> now looks like this (after deleting the usual copyright notices at the top). The blobs beside the line numbers indicate a connection to the interface in the storyboard.</p>
<p><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/01/ViewControllerSwift.png" alt="ViewControllerSwift"></p>
<p>Build and run the app.</p>
<p>Click the <em>Say Hello</em> button without entering anything and you will see “Hello World!”. Now type in your name and click the button again to see your own personal greeting.</p>
<p><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/01/HelloWorld.png" alt="HelloWorld"></p>
<h2><span id="debugging"> Debugging</span></h2>
<p>Sometimes, we programmers make mistakes – hard to believe I know, but trust me, it happens. And when it does, we need to be able to debug our code. Xcode allows us to stop the code at any point and step through line by line, checking the values of the variables at each point so that we can find the error.</p>
<p>Go to <code>sayButtonClicked</code> in <em>ViewController.swift</em> and click on the line number beside the <code>var name =</code>line. A blue pointed rectangle will appear. This is an active breakpoint and when you click the button, the debugger will stop here. Click it again and it will turn pale blue. It is now an inactive breakpoint and will not stop the code and start the debugger. To remove the breakpoint completely, drag it out of the line numbers gutter.</p>
<p><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/01/Breakpoint.png" alt="Breakpoint"></p>
<p>Add the breakpoint again and run the app. Click the <em>Say Hello</em> button. Xcode will come to the front with the breakpoint line of code highlighted. In the bottom of the <em>Editor</em> panel, there will now be two new sections: <em>Variables</em> and <em>Console</em>. The <em>Variables</em> section shows the variables used in this function as well as <code>self</code> – the View Controller, and <code>sender</code> – the button.</p>
<p><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/01/Stopped.png" alt="Stopped"></p>
<p>Above the <em>Variables</em> display is a set of buttons for controlling the debugger. Mouse over each one and read the tooltop to see what it does. Click the <em>Step Over</em> button to move to the next line.</p>
<p>In the <em>Variables</em> display, you can check that <code>name</code> is an empty string, so click <em>Step Over</em> twice more. The debugger will move into and through the <code>if</code> statement and set the <code>name</code> variable to “World”.</p>
<p>Select the <code>name</code> variable in the <em>Variables</em> display and click the <em>Quick Look</em> button below to see the contents. Now click the <em>Print Description</em> button to see the information printed in the <em>Console</em>. If the “World” value had not been set correctly, you would have been able to see that here and work out how to fix your code.</p>
<p><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/01/PrintVariable.png" alt="PrintVariable"></p>
<p>When you have checked the contents of the name variable, click the <em>Continue program execution</em> button to stop debugging and let the program move on. Use the button in the top right to hide the Debug area.</p>
<h2><span id="images"> Images</span></h2>
<p>In addition to code and user interfaces, your app will also need some artwork. Due to the different screen types (Retina and non-Retina), you often need to provide multiple versions of each asset. To simplify this process, Xcode uses <em>Asset Libraries</em> to store and organize the assets that accompany the app.</p>
<p>In the <em>Project Navigator</em>, click on <em>Assets.xcassets</em>. The only item there so far is <em>AppIcon</em> which will contain the various images needed to display the app icon in all the required resolutions. Click on <em>AppIcon</em>– you can see that it wants 10 different images to cover all the possibilities, but if you supply any one of these, Xcode will use it as best it can. This is not good practice, as you should supply all the required icon sizes, but for this tutorial one icon will be sufficient.</p>
<p>Download the <a href="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/02/rw_logo.png.zip" target="_blank" rel="external">sample icon</a> which is a 512 x 512 pixel image. Drag it into the <em>Mac 512pt 1x</em> box.</p>
<p><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/01/AppIcon.png" alt="AppIcon"></p>
<p>Build and run the app to see the icon in the Dock menu. If you still see the default app icon, quit the HelloWorld app, go back to Xcode and choose <em>Clean</em> from the <em>Product</em> menu, then run the app again.</p>
<p><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/01/DockIcon.png" alt="DockIcon"></p>
<h2><span id="getting-help"> Getting Help</span></h2>
<p>As well as being an editor, Xcode also contains all the documentation you will need for writing macOS apps.</p>
<p>Go to the <em>Help</em> menu and choose <em>Documentation and API Reference</em>. Search for <em>NSButton</em>. Make sure Swift is the selected language, then click the top search result so that you can read all the details about buttons and button properties.</p>
<p><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/01/Docs.png" alt="Docs"></p>
<p>There is also a way to get to relevant documentation directly from your code. Go back to <em>ViewController.swift</em> and find the first line in <code>sayButtonClicked</code>. <em>Option-click</em> on the word <code>stringValue</code>. A popup appears with a short description. At the bottom of the popup is a link to <em>Property Reference</em>. Click this link and the documentation will open to show more information.</p>
<p><img src="https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/01/OptionClick.png" alt="OptionClick"></p>
<p><em>Option-clicking</em> is often a really good way to learn, and you can even add documentation to your own functions so that it shows up in the same way.</p>
