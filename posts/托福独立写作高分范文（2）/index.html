<h3><span id="51should-people-be-taught-how-to-manage-money-at-an-early-age"> 51．Should people be taught how to manage money at an early age?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>Money is such a <strong>controversial topic</strong> that even adults are labeling it as a <strong>private matter</strong>. In spite of this, the reality in today’s money-oriented society urges everyone to struggle for desirable incomes. Just as the popular saying goes, “Money isn’t everything, but humans can never do without it.” Faced with the increasingly powerful domination of money, people ought to take precautions as early as possible so as not to become slaves of wealth. Thereafter, in order to be financially responsible <strong>stewards</strong>, young children deserve to be given instructions on money management.</p>
<p>First of all, managing money makes children realize the importance of <strong>thrift</strong>. “A penny saved is a penny earned.” Saving money is a good habit that needs to be formed at an early age. If children are instructed to save their <strong>allowances</strong>, they may naturally <strong>wonder about</strong> the reason to do so. After learning the fact that money is earned through the hard work of their parents, they will no longer waste money <strong>on purpose</strong> from then on. It paves a way for them to become <strong>rational consumers</strong> and intelligent investors in the future. Even today, I still have a little <strong>piggy bank</strong> by my side. It is a gift from my uncle. In my childhood, I used to put all my <strong>pocket coins</strong> into it. <strong>With</strong> <strong>the passing of time</strong>, such a habit continues and is to be continued. After all, <strong>frugality</strong> is an essential quality in a financially responsible adult.</p>
<p>On the other hand, managing money helps children learn how to use it properly. Saving for future uses is a highly cherished value nowadays. With a goal in mind, they may enjoy the process of saving and are convinced that it is <strong>absolutely</strong> worthwhile to have a plan and wait until the goal is achieved. Besides, saving allowances may also give children a strong sense of fulfillment when they can buy something through their own efforts. To illustrate, my little nephew could be mentioned. He had always dreamed of obtaining a <strong>model plane</strong>. His mother asked him to save enough allowance money before he could buy it. At last, he succeeded and his dream model is now in his possession. <strong>Anyhow</strong>, saving money for a goal is a meaningful experience.</p>
<p>Last but not least, being allowed to control money, children are granted the opportunity to <strong>hold objective</strong> <strong>attitudes toward</strong> wealth and form correct life values. Parents may <strong>take advantage of</strong> the money-managing process to let them know that money should be obtained through one’s own efforts. A waste of money is to be strictly prohibited. In addition, children may also be taught to <strong>donate</strong> a little portion of their money to those who are in need. These are all treasured values in a qualified member of society.</p>
<p>To sum up, children deserve the right to manage money. Traditional financial concept should be <strong>converted</strong> to teach them in today’s market economy. It is high time that wise parents should <strong>draw up</strong> measured plans and teach their children to mange money. After all, these efforts will <strong>pay off</strong> sooner or later.</p>

<p>51．人们应该在很小的时候就学习如何理财吗？</p>
<p>金钱是一个颇具争议的话题，甚至成年人都把它当做隐私。尽管如此，当今金钱社会的现实促使每个人都为理想的收入而奋力拼搏。正如一句名言所述，“钱不是万能的，但没有钱是万万不能的。”随着金钱的控制力越来越强，人们应该尽早预防以免自己成为财富的奴隶。因此，为了成为有经济责任感的管家，孩子们应该得到理财方面的指导。</p>
<p>首先，管理钱财能使孩子们意识到节俭的重要。“省一文等于挣一文。”省钱是从小就应该养成的好习惯。如果大人指导孩子们将零用钱存下来，他们会很自然地思索其原因。当了解到钱是通过父母辛勤工作挣来的这个事实时，他们从此就不会再故意浪费了。这就为他们在未来能够成为理性消费者和智慧投资人铺平了道路。直至今天，我仍然保留着一个小猪存钱罐。那是叔叔送给我的礼物。小时候，我曾经把自己所有的零用钱币放在里面。随着时间的流逝，这个习惯一直持续着，而且也将持续下去。毕竟，勤俭节约是有经济责任感的成年人的基本素质之一。</p>
<p>另一方面，管理钱财有助于孩子学会如何合理使用金钱。为未来所需而攒钱是当今高度推崇的理念。心中有了目标，孩子们也许会喜欢存钱的过程，并且坚信制订一个计划直至目标达成是绝对值得的。此外，当通过自己的努力买到某个物品的时候，这些攒下的钱会给孩子一种成就感。我的小外甥就是一个好例子。他一直梦想着拥有一架模型飞机。他的妈妈让他积攒足够的零用钱以后再买。最后，他终于成功了。如今他已经得到了梦想中的模型飞机。不管怎样，为一个目标存钱是有意义的经历。</p>
<p>最后，得到控制钱财的许可使孩子们有机会对财富持有客观的态度并形成正确的人生观。家长可以利用理财的过程让他们懂得，金钱是通过自己的努力挣来的。浪费金钱应被严格禁止。此外，孩子们还能学会把自己的一部分钱捐给需要的人。这些都是合格社会成员必备的珍贵品质。</p>
<p>总之，孩子们理应获得管理钱财的权利。传统的理财观也可以在当前市场经济形势之下用来教育他们。明智的家长们是该制订出慎重的计划以教导孩子理财观念了。毕竟，这些努力早晚定会有所回报。</p>

<h3><span id="52should-teachers-be-paid-according-to-their-students-performance"> 52．Should teachers be paid according to their students’ performance?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>Today, changes to teachers’ salary standards are an <strong>earnest concern</strong> in many countries. There have already been diversified motions and programs so far. Hence, it is imperative for governments to find solutions to these issues. A hotly-discussed proposal has been brought to attention recently regarding the <strong>feasibility</strong> of paying teachers according to how well their students perform. If I were the <strong>decision maker</strong>, I would definitely support it.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the program urges teachers to enhance their <strong>teaching efficiency</strong>. Normally, one’s salary is a major stimulus to improve the quality of his work. When students are unable to make progress or perform unsatisfactorily in their school work, such outcomes reflect negatively upon teachers. Such a psychological state will naturally lead to competition among teachers to raise the general level of their students. Winning the competition not only <strong>justifies</strong> their teaching ability, but also helps students learn. As long as such pressures function well and are finally turned into impetus, there is every reason to believe that greater efforts will be made. Without doubt, the major purpose of school education is to produce positive influences on the students and instruct them to perform well in studies. Where there is a will, there is a way. The adoption of better teaching methods and the improved personal guidance of teachers <strong>contribute to</strong> the <strong>realization</strong> of this goal.</p>
<p>In addition, students will receive more attention from their teachers because of this motion. The traditional “teacher-centered” mode of teaching allows a teacher to <strong>rule the</strong> classroom <strong>roost</strong> by using a <strong>prescribed</strong> approach to teach a <strong>generic curriculum</strong> to everyone at the same time. The domination of teachers in class makes it difficult for them to affect effective two-way communication. In these types of classrooms, students are passive <strong>spectators</strong>, which considerably undermines their confidence and learning passion. However, if a more “student-based” learning atmosphere is created due to the implementation of the proposal, students might be more active in their studies. Teachers are attaching greater importance to the <strong>individuality</strong> of each student, so as to instruct them more effectively. Hence, the gap between teachers and students is narrowed. As soon as effective communication is ensured, teaching and learning performance will be improved.</p>
<p>Admittedly, several defects of this proposal ought to be noted. On the one hand, some of the teachers may <strong>be</strong> <strong>unwilling to</strong> teach a class with more low-level students, which might lead to unnecessary troubles. On the other hand, some students may endure too much pressure from their teachers, which may threaten their health and incur <strong>a loss of self-confidence</strong>.</p>
<p>As a result, a number of factors ought to be taken into consideration before such an innovative proposal is finally passed and implemented. Bearing in mind the merits as well as the negative possibilities <strong>elaborated</strong> above, I would render my support to the notion that teachers can be paid on the basis of their students’ performance.</p>

<p>52．教师应根据他们学生的表现优劣拿工资吗？</p>
<p>目前，很多国家都在热切关注教师工资的调整。迄今为止已经有多种提议和计划。因此，寻找问题的解决方法是政府的当务之急。一项议案日前引起了热烈的讨论，议案是关于教师根据学生表现领工资的可行性。如果我是决策人，我必定会投赞成票。</p>
<p>首先，此议案促使教师提高教学成果。工资通常是推进一个人改进工作质量的主要因素。当学生无法取得进步，或在功课中表现不理想的时候，这会使教师自我反省。如此心理状态自然会引起教师之间的竞争以提高学生的整体水平。在竞争中取胜不仅证实了他们的教学能力，还有助于学生的学习。只要这种压力很好地发挥作用并最终转化为动力的话，我们有充足的理由相信老师们会作出更大的努力。毫无疑问，学校教育的主要目的是对学生产生积极的影响，并指导他们好好学习。有志者事竟成。通过采用更优质的教学方法，并改善对学生的个人指导，老师们就有可能达到这个目标。</p>
<p>此外，这个提议使学生们获得教师的更多关注。在传统的“以教师为中心”的教学模式中，教师占据课堂的主导，他们通过使用预先设计的教案给班里每位同学统一授课。这种课堂完全由教师掌控的教学模式阻碍了有效的双向沟通，在这种课堂中，学生成了被动的接收容器，这极大摧毁了他们的自信与学习热情。然而，倘若此项议题得以实施，一个更加“以学生为中心”的学习氛围便可以建立起来，学生就会更加主动地学习。教师更加注重每个学生的个性，从而使教学更有效地进行。于是，师生之间的鸿沟变窄了。一旦这种有效沟通得到保证，教学和学习效果都会得以改善。</p>
<p>必须承认，此议题的几个缺陷不应被忽视。一方面，有的教师也许不愿意教整体水平较低的班级，这也许会招致不必要的麻烦。另一方面，有的学生会承受老师施加的过多压力，这会威胁他们的健康，并使其失去自信。</p>
<p>因此，在这个革新提议最终被通过并实施之前，需要综合考虑若干因素。通过权衡前文所谈及的优势与负面可能性，我认为，“教师根据学生的表现拿工资”是可行的方案。</p>

<h3><span id="53be-more-like-others-or-be-different-from-everyone-else"> 53．Be more like others or be different from everyone else?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>Diversity is a dominant contributor to the <strong>splendors</strong> of nature. The same is true with the human world, where everyone is supposed to be a unique individual. In order to be a winner in world of tough competition, one should stand out as different from his counterparts. Such a reality seems to be a common characteristic shared by almost all the professional fields today. It further justifies the significance of uniqueness. In my view, being different from others tends to be a <strong>decisive</strong> element that can ensure a person’s career or academic success.</p>
<p>In fact, uniqueness can make one a pioneer in a certain field. If a person has become a pioneer and gained <strong>heart-felt</strong> acknowledgement from others, then he is undoubtedly a great success. As a matter of fact, being a pioneer is not an easy task. It involves untiring diligence and requires overwhelming courage to differ from everyone else. Definitely, the <strong>concrete</strong> determination to be unique <strong>brings</strong> a pioneer <strong>to the limelight</strong>. History is full of eminent pioneers, all of whom have once made brave decisions to be different. Bill Gates is one of the most unique and successful pioneers the world has ever witnessed. At the moment when he left Harvard, other people couldn’t understand why he gave up an education at such a world-renowned university. At last, his unique courage finally paid off. The success of Microsoft made him the wealthiest man ever.</p>
<p>Just as an old Chinese saying goes, “<strong>The rarer it is, the more it is worth</strong>.” Being different from others adds to one’s value, which complies with an aspect of human nature. Uniqueness is a way to make a person or a commodity more precious than others. In today’s highly competitive job market, <strong>job-seekers</strong> just resemble products to be traded. If one possesses different qualities, he is more likely to be noticed and remembered. Deeper impressions left on the employers further ensure his success in winning a position. Even in one’s career life, presenting different views on a project plan or <strong>coming up with</strong> creative ideas will continue to <strong>sustain</strong> him as a <strong>differentiated</strong> individual. After all, success is only in the hands of the minority. We may find evidence in a jobhunting program on CCTV: in most cases, those candidates who have presented their <strong>eye-catching</strong> uniqueness are more welcome by the judges and the audience.</p>
<p>However, refusing to follow suit does not mean there is no necessity to learn from others. Many factors are combined together to make a man outstanding and successful. The <strong>precondition</strong> of being unique is to first know others thoroughly. In <em>the Art of War</em>, <strong>Master Sun</strong> once taught us an essential strategy: “<strong>Know the enemy</strong> <strong>and know yourself, and you can win a hundred battles without a defeat</strong>.” This perfectly demonstrates the importance of <strong>modesty</strong> on the way to success. In a sense, knowing others while maintaining one’s uniqueness helps enhance one’s chances to win.</p>
<p>In a word, the pursuit of uniqueness is found in all individuals who dream of accomplishing success. Without doubt, in today’s increasingly competitive social environment, no one wishes to be similar to others. Although it takes pains to stand out and exhibit one’s difference from everyone else, it will for sure bring about fruitful reward <strong>in the days to come</strong>.</p>

<p>53．更从众还是与众不同？</p>
<p>多样性造就了大自然的绚丽多彩。人类社会也是如此，每个人都应该是与众不同的个体。为了在这个充满激烈竞争的世界中取胜，就必须从众人中脱颖而出。这个现实似乎已成为大多数职业领域的共同特征。这就更进一步证实了与众不同的重要。在我看来，独树一帜是确保一个人职业或学业成功的决定性因素之一。</p>
<p>其实，与众不同能够使人成为某领域的先锋。倘若一位先锋获得了他人由衷的认可，那么他／她无疑是极为成功的。事实上，要想成为先锋并非易事，它需要不懈的勤奋以及敢于和他人不同的超强勇气。志在独一无二的坚定决心将先锋置于聚光灯之下。历史上就有很多杰出的先锋，他们都曾经勇敢地下定决心要与众不同。比尔·盖茨是世界上最与众不同也是最成功的先锋之一。在他辍学离开哈佛大学的时候，其他人无法理解他为何会放弃在如此举世闻名的大学里受教育的机会。最终，他独特的勇气终于得到了回报。微软公司的成功使他成为了世界首富。</p>
<p>中国古代有一句名言，“物以稀为贵。”与众不同提升了人的自身价值，这符合人性的某一方面。稀有使得一个人或一件商品更为珍贵。在今天高度竞争的人才市场上，求职者好比等待交易的商品。如果他／她拥有特殊的品质，就更有可能受到关注并（给用人单位）留下更深刻的印象，这就进一步确保了他／她成功谋得某个职位。甚至在职业生涯中，表达自己对一个项目计划的不同见解或产生创造性的想法会继续使他／她成为一个与众不同的人。毕竟，成功只掌握在少数人手中。我们可以在中央电视台某求职栏目中得到印证：大多数情况下，那些展示出自己引人注目的特色的候选人更受评委和观众的欢迎。</p>
<p>然而，拒绝模仿他人并不意味着没必要向他人学习。多种因素结合起来才能造就出众的成功人士。与众不同的前提条件就是首先彻底了解别人。在《孙子兵法》一书中，孙子曾经教给我们一项基本战略，那就是“知己知彼，百战不殆。”这生动地证明了谦虚对成功有多重要。在某种意义上，在了解他人的同时保持自己的个性可以提高成功几率。</p>
<p>总之，个性已经成为所有梦想成功者的共同追求。毋庸置疑，在当今竞争愈发激烈的社会环境中，没有人情愿与他人雷同。尽管变得出色并展示出自己的与众不同是艰难的，这必将在未来转化为丰厚的回报。</p>

<h3><span id="54does-technology-make-peoples-lives-simpler-rather-than-more-complicated"> 54．Does technology make people’s lives simpler rather than more complicated?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>As a <strong>double-edged sword</strong>, technology has frequently been brought to the center of <strong>heated debates</strong>. Some people argue that the advancement of modern science and technology has made life much simpler than before, while some others offer an opposite attitude, <strong>insisting that</strong> technology may cause trouble to and complicate their daily life. I would tend to express a <strong>neutral</strong> standpoint on this issue. That is to say, technology has made people’s lives easier in some aspects, whereas it makes life more complicated in some other areas.</p>
<p>On the one hand, thanks to tremendous accomplishments of scientists in many fields, people’s lives have been made much simpler than in the past. With easy clicks of the mouse, the striking speed of computers is vividly displayed. Complicated figures are accurately calculated and arranged, all while human brains are comfortably at rest, <strong>unneeded for</strong> these tasks. Thus, a large amount of trouble is avoided. Messages can be sent at ease through diversified technological channels including telephone, computer, radio and television. Besides, the adoption of advanced machines has remarkably raised <strong>productivity</strong>. Specially-designed technological systems can tackle the most complex tasks in a short time. From a certain angle, human beings are made much lazier than before with the <strong>all-around application of technology</strong>. Furthermore, seldom do people use pens and paper to write articles or letters now, as it is more convenient to type words in almost any language. There is no longer a need to <strong>write in</strong> <strong>ink</strong>. Ironically, the most common <strong>handwriting</strong> today might be a person’s signature.</p>
<p>On the other hand, excessive reliance on technological support may also bring forth unfavorable effects in people’s daily lives. In the modern world, there have frequently been occurrences of <strong>power failures</strong> or technological <strong>crashes and breakdowns</strong> that prevent people from utilizing technology temporarily. As a consequence, humans might be trapped, with endless problems to be handled independently with their own brains and their own hands. All these troubles are far from simple to deal with. To illustrate, imagine that inside an office during working hours the electricity of the building suddenly <strong>goes out</strong>. The computers refuse to work and all other <strong>electricity-run</strong> equipment comes to a halt. What might be the <strong>aftermath</strong> of such an incident? Undoubtedly, many important tasks and projects will not be continued and the progress of work is also negatively affected. It is most likely that clerks have to wait until the networks recover, without doing anything practical and meaningful for a while. Delays of work would be unavoidable. With this in mind, technology indeed <strong>instills</strong> complicated troubles <strong>into</strong> people’s lives.</p>
<p>It is a must to hold a rational attitude toward technology and make suitable use of it. People in the modern world can never live without the all-around assistance of technology; however, it does not mean that total reliance on it is completely necessary. Even technology itself is invented by human power and intelligence. As a result, while trying hard to master technological skills, human beings should also be conscious of the necessity to maintain and cultivate more <strong>primitive</strong> abilities. Only in this way could unwanted troubles be reduced to the largest extent possible.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the double-sided nature of technology has caused opposite impacts on people’s lives under different circumstances. In some cases, it indeed helps enhance living standards and makes life more convenient and comfortable; yet in some other aspects, technology may also become a source of complexity. With the purpose of letting it bring about the biggest benefits to the entire human race, all ordinary citizens should be fully aware of the importance of suitable technological applications.</p>

<p>54．技术使人们的生活变得更加简单而不是更加复杂吗？</p>
<p>作为一把双刃剑，技术屡次成为众人热烈争论的焦点。有些人认为现代科技的发展使人们的生活比以前简单了，而有些人则立场相反，他们坚持认为技术会给日常生活带来麻烦并使其复杂化。我对此倾向于保持中立态度。也就是说，技术在一些方面简化了人们的生活，而在另一些方面使生活更加复杂了。</p>
<p>一方面，由于多领域科学家们的杰出成就，人们的生活变得比以前更容易了。只需轻松点击鼠标，电脑的惊人速度便跃然入目。复杂的数据可以得到精确地计算与整理，所有这些都是在人脑轻松休息、未承担任何任务的情况下进行的。这就避免了很多麻烦。消息可以借助电话、电脑、收音机和电视等多种科技渠道轻而易举地发送。此外，发达的机器设备已经极大提高了生产率。专门设计的技术系统可以在短时间内完成大多数复杂的任务。从某个角度来看，由于科技的全方位应用，人类变得比以前更加懒惰了。更有甚者，现在的人们很少用笔和纸写文章或写信了，因为几乎所有语言都可以通过键盘打出来，于是就不再有用墨水书写的必要了。讽刺的是，如今最常见的手写文字也许就是一个人的签名。</p>
<p>另一方面，过度依赖技术支持也可能给人们的日常生活带来负面影响。在现代世界里，经常会发生停电、技术崩溃和机器故障，这些都暂时终止了技术的作用。于是，人类可能被困在无数需要自己动手动脑解决的问题之中。应付这些麻烦远没那么简单。比如，设想在一座办公大楼里，恰逢上班时间，突然停电了。电脑停止工作，所有其他电子设备停止运转。后果又会怎样呢？毫无疑问，很多重要的任务和项目无法进行下去，从而影响了工作的进展。最有可能的是，职员们不得不坐等技术网络的全面恢复，而暂时不做任何实际的和有意义的事情。工作延误是在所难免的。鉴于此，技术的确给人们的生活注入了麻烦。</p>
<p>我们必须对技术持有理性的态度并合理利用它。现代世界的人们离不开科技的全面协助。然而，这并不意味着完全依赖技术是绝对有必要的。甚至技术本身也是依靠人类的力量和智慧发明的。因此，在尽力掌握技术本领的同时，人类还应该意识到维持和培养更加“原始”能力的重要性。只有这样才可能将不必要的麻烦降低到最大程度。</p>
<p>因此，在不同情况下，技术的两面性已经对人们的生活产生了截然相反的影响。在某些方面，它的确提高了生活水平，使生活更加方便舒适；然而在其他方面，技术也可能成为复杂的源头。为了使其为整个人类带来最大的益处，所有普通公民都应该充分意识到合理应用技术的重要性。</p>

<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>The high <strong>migration</strong> rate nowadays indicates the fact that fewer modern citizens are determined to spend their entire lifetime in a single place. Moving to another place has become a fashionable choice for many young people. <strong>Admittedly</strong>, for some <strong>senior citizens</strong>, they might be unwilling to leave their hometowns for an unfamiliar environment. However, as far as I am concerned, younger people ought to be encouraged to experience life and work in new places.</p>
<p>To begin with, both social and economic development demands the migration of human resources. In order to ensure the smooth running of a <strong>vigorous</strong> economy, <strong>talent flows</strong> ought to be well sustained. Today, an increasing number of young students are leaving their homes to study and work in different regions for long periods. Such a tendency intensifies mutual support between different places and steps up overall social construction. As for <strong>underdeveloped</strong> places, receiving more human resources benefits local economic development; conversely, developed places are cultivating useful talents for the whole society. To illustrate, in China the majority of high school graduates choose to further their education in a new city or even a foreign country. After graduation from college, they might select a place which possesses the greatest potential for them to fully utilize their skills. Indeed, the prosperity of a region owes much to the <strong>unceasing</strong> flow of talented outlanders.</p>
<p>Secondly, living in a new place enriches young people with life experiences and also broadens their minds. As a matter of fact, life can <strong>be compared to</strong> a long journey. Each individual deserves the right to travel and move to another place. Living in a new atmosphere opens one’s mind and makes his life colorful and meaningful. In addition, with the purpose of comprehending different cultures and values, it is a must for one to be fully immersed into a new environment and intimately contact the details of life there. Such treasured experiences are key elements that make a person <strong>mature and sapient</strong>. Thus, they need to be accumulated <strong>continuously</strong> and over a long period of time.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, moving to a new place does not mean never going back to the place where one belongs. Just as an old Chinese saying goes, “<strong>Fallen leaves return to their roots</strong>.” Take China for example. The Southern and Eastern provinces are comparatively more developed than the great West. Young people from the West are most willing to receive higher education in the South or the East. In the past, many such students settled down in those places after graduation instead of returning to their home cities. Today, however, this situation has changed to a large degree. With the government’s implementation of <strong>the “Develop the West” strategy</strong>, more and more talented students are determined to return to the West and contribute to the economy there.</p>
<p>In sum, people of different age groups have different choices for their temporary and long-term residences. It is a wise idea for older people to stay in stable and familiar places so as to pursue convenience and comfort. By contrast, the young are in a better position to migrate to new places to accumulate rich living and working experiences. After all, economic prosperity in modern society depends largely on reasonable human resource flows.</p>

<p>55．人们应该终生住在同一座城市或者同一个国家，而不应搬迁到其他地方去吗？</p>
<p>如今的高移民率表明，越来越少的现代居民决心在同一个地方度过一生。搬迁到异乡已经成为许多年轻人的时尚之选。不能否认，对于有的老年人来说，他们是不愿意背井离乡搬到陌生环境里去的。然而我认为，应该鼓励年轻人去新地方体验生活并在那里工作。</p>
<p>首先，社会和经济发展需要人力资源的迁徙。为了确保充满活力的经济能够顺利运行，人才流动必须得到很好的维持。如今，有更多年轻学生都离开故乡，长期在其他地方学习和工作。这个趋势加强了不同地区间的互助，并促进了社会的全面建设。对于欠发达地区，接受更多人力资源造福于当地的经济发展；相比之下，发达地区为整个社会培养着有用的人才。例如，在中国，大多数高中毕业生都选择到另一个城市甚至另一个国家深造。大学毕业以后，他们可能留在能充分发挥自己潜力的地方工作。的确，地区繁荣在很大程度上归功于持续的外地人才流入。</p>
<p>第二，在新地方生活可以丰富年轻人的生活阅历，同时也能开阔人们的思想。其实，人生犹如长途旅行。每个人都拥有周游各地并搬迁到另一处的权利。居住在崭新的氛围中会拓宽视野，并使人生多彩且有意义。此外，要想理解不同的文化和价值观，人们必须完全融入到新环境中并与那里的生活细节亲密接触。这些宝贵的经验是使人成熟和智慧的关键要素，因此，需要长时间不断的积累。</p>
<p>然而，搬到异地并不意味着永远不再回到自己的故乡。中国有句俗话，“落叶归根。”就以中国为例，相比之下，南部和东部省份比大西部更发达。来自西部的年轻人大都愿意在南部或东部接受高等教育。过去，很多学生在毕业后选择定居在那里，而不是回到家乡城市工作。如今，情况已经大为改观了。随着政府“西部大开发”战略的实施，越来越多的有才华的学生决心回到西部并为那里的经济作贡献。</p>
<p>总之，处于不同年龄阶段的人对于他们暂时和长久居住地的选择也有所不同。老年人最好住在稳定且熟悉的环境中以求方便与舒适，而年轻人则应该去新环境积累丰富的生活和工作经验。毕竟，现代社会的经济繁荣在很大程度上依赖于合理的人员流动。</p>

<h3><span id="56does-telephone-have-greater-influence-on-peoples-lives-than-tv"> 56．Does telephone have greater influence on people’s lives than TV?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>As two dominant inventions in human history, both the telephone and the TV are indispensable tools in people’s daily lives. Almost every household has <strong>installed</strong> a TV set and a telephone. Ample amounts of information are spread through TV, information that can be both educational and <strong>recreational</strong>. Likewise, the telephone has made communication more convenient than ever. On the busy streets, many <strong>pedestrians</strong> are seen holding a cell phone in their hands. Nonetheless, due to the prevalence of the Internet, the influence of television has been lessened. As a result, the telephone has indeed become more influential nowadays.</p>
<p>To begin with, the telephone allows <strong>instant communication</strong> between people. Just like an <strong>Invisible</strong> bridge, signals sent back and forth from the caller to the receiver are connecting people wherever they are. With the simple <strong>dialing</strong> of numbers, a person <strong>is blessed with</strong> the opportunity to speak to a friend far away and hear his voice directly through the telephone. This form of communication is <strong>dramatically</strong> significant, for the messages delivered during the course of a phone call may be critical and urgent. It is due to such a <strong>magical</strong> power that the telephone makes itself a most reliable tool to assist mutual contacts among people, especially in moments of <strong>emergency</strong> or other important situations. Thus, the telephone is far more practical and useful than TV. For instance, when residents are trapped in an <strong>elevator</strong> between two floors, making a call can save them from danger.</p>
<p>In addition, the <strong>multifunctional</strong> and <strong>intellectual</strong> nature of modern telephones have added to their usefulness to people’s lives. Cell phones manufactured today, for instance, have been made as smart as a <strong>micro-computer</strong> or a versatile <strong>portable device</strong>. They have progressed far beyond the fundamental making of phone calls and sending of short messages. Users are able to <strong>browse</strong> websites online via cell phones and download different types of utility software, like dictionaries, electric <strong>torches</strong>, chatting tools, electronic book readers and more. Normally, a <strong>GPS</strong> is also installed inside the telephone, with <strong>accurate</strong> satellite maps sustaining searches for any location around the globe. Meanwhile, they are also installed with <strong>digital cameras</strong>, mp3 and movie players as well as diversified electronic games. These functions are making cell phones even more entertaining. In a sense, mobile phones are not merely tools for communication, but also becoming more educational and recreational than any advanced television.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, people’s use of TV has been lessened due to the prosperity of the IT industry <strong>in the new</strong> <strong>era</strong>. Nowadays, the Internet is gradually taking up a dominant position formerly held by TV. Fewer and fewer modern citizens could do without going online everyday, because on the computer they can access the latest news, get connected to world-wide radio and TV programs, and watch movies or videos to their hearts’ content. By contrast, watching TV is no longer a daily necessity as before. People are becoming less obsessed with the relatively lesser functions of such a traditional machine.</p>
<p>In sum, the mobile and diversified functions of telephones have considerably extended their impact on people’s lives in the modern world. Comparatively speaking, the position of TV is no longer as important as it was in the last century. <strong>Judging from</strong> the reasons listed above, we can easily draw the conclusion that the modern telephone has greater influence than TV.</p>

<p>56．电话对人们生活的影响大于电视吗？</p>
<p>作为人类历史上两大发明，电话和电视是人们日常生活中不可或缺的工具。几乎每个家庭都安装了电视机和电话。大量教育资源与娱乐信息通过电视传播。同样，电话使沟通比以往更加方便。在繁忙的大街上，很多行人手里都拿着手机。然而，由于互联网的普及，电视的影响有所削弱。因此，电话的确变得更有影响力了。</p>
<p>首先，电话允许人们进行即时交流。如同一座无形的桥梁，电话信号在主叫和被叫人之间来回传送，并将各地的人们连接在一起。只需轻松拨打号码，人们就拥有与远方朋友说话并直接听到对方声音的机会。这种沟通方式是意义非凡的，因为打电话过程中传递的信息也许是至关重要和紧迫的。正是由于这种神奇的力量才使电话成为协助人们互相联系的最可靠工具，尤其是在紧急情况下或在其他重要场合中。因此，电话比电视更实用。比如，当居民被困在两层楼之间的电梯里时，拨打求助电话就能脱离危险。</p>
<p>此外，多功能与智能化增加了现代电话对人们生活的用处。例如，最新生产的手机已经像微型电脑或全能便携装置一样智能了。它们的发展远远超越了打电话和发短信的初衷。使用者能够通过手机浏览网站并下载各种应用软件，如电子词典、手电、聊天工具、电子阅读器等。手机上通常也安装了GPS全球定位系统，提供精确的卫星地图以协助搜索地球上任何地点。与此同时，它们也安装有数码相机、mp3和电影播放器以及各种电子游戏。这些功能使手机更具有娱乐性。在某种意义上，移动电话已不仅仅是交流工具了，而且已经变得比任何高级电视都更具有教育性和娱乐性了。</p>
<p>事实上，由于新时代信息产业的繁荣，人们对电视的使用率已经下降。如今，互联网逐渐占据了曾经被电视掌控的地位。越来越多的现代居民每天都离不开网络，因为通过电脑他们可以浏览新闻、收听全球网络广播和电视节目、尽情地观看电影或视频。相比之下，看电视已经不再像以前一样是日常所需了。由于这种传统机器相对有限的功能，人们对其迷恋程度有所减少。</p>
<p>总之，电话的便携与多样化功能已经极大地增强了其对现代世界人们生活的影响。相比之下，电视的地位不再像上世纪那么重要了。根据上述原因我们可以很容易地判断，如今，电话的影响已经超过了电视。</p>

<h3><span id="57is-it-more-important-to-have-rules-about-the-types-of-clothing-that-people-wear-at-work-or-at-school"> 57．Is it more important to have rules about the types of clothing that people wear at work or at school?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>Should restrictions be <strong>enforced</strong> on the types of clothing to be worn at work and at school? From my view, the answer is <strong>positive</strong>. These rules could definitely help create the most suitable working and studying environment for staffs and students. As a consequence, even though not all schools or companies have designed uniforms for their members, it is a must to <strong>formulate</strong> related disciplines that <strong>clarify</strong> what kinds of clothing are strictly prohibited during working and studying hours.</p>
<p>First of all, suitable dressing styles on formal occasions remind employees and students to concentrate more on their duties. Admittedly, the pursuit of good looks is a focus of every individual. Yet paying too much attention to fashionable clothing might negatively affect work and studies. Needless to say, trying to <strong>follow fashion</strong> every day is not only a waste of time, but also proves energy-consuming. If related rules are issued by company and school <strong>authorities</strong>, employees and students will <strong>be obliged to</strong> dress formally without having to care excessively about their <strong>outward appearances</strong>. For example, professional suits may be the best choice for office clerks. In most cases, school uniforms are the only type of clothing permitted to wear on campuses. Thus, students need not consider how to wear clothing uniquely and beautifully. Anyway, offices and schools are places for people to perform their tasks rather than to show off their personal taste of dressing styles. Attentiveness <strong>is of paramount</strong> <strong>importance</strong> to enhance working and learning efficiency.</p>
<p>Besides, dressing rules help display favorable images to the public. As important social organs, enterprises and schools shoulder the responsibility to exhibit their overall qualities to the masses. <strong>Suppose</strong> everyone is allowed the freedom to choose his own styles of clothing: there might be an <strong>emergence</strong> of <strong>eccentric</strong> styles that could severely damage the good image of an entire organization. Keeping to the modest principles of clothing styles is absolutely a best way to maintain the original essences of these social units.</p>
<p><strong>Notwithstanding</strong>, obeying rules of dress at work at and school does not mean the complete <strong>denial</strong> of fashion and beauty. Every social member is entitled to possess good looks. Therefore, it is highly advisable that designers and clothing manufacturers try their best to design special styles of working suits or uniforms that appear more fashionable and attractive.</p>
<p>In sum, there is every reason to believe that setting rules about <strong>conservative</strong> dress helps ensure the maintenance of a suitable atmosphere for working and learning. It should be a basic obligation for people to obey these rules. Meanwhile, all social units ought to make unremitting efforts to <strong>supervise</strong> the <strong>smooth implementation</strong> of these principles. Only in this way can a suitable environment be established.</p>

<p>57．设立规定以限制人们工作或上学时的着装类型有必要吗？</p>
<p>应该对人们工作或上学时的穿着类别强加限制吗？在我看来，答案是肯定的。这些规定确定有助于为员工和学生创建最适宜的工作与学习环境。因此，尽管不是所有的学校或公司都为其成员设计制服，制定相关规定来明确学习与工作期间严格禁止的着装类别是有必要的。</p>
<p>首先，在正式场合着装合理能够使员工和学生专注于他们的任务。不可否认，爱美之心人皆有之。然而，过多在意时装流行也许会对他们的工作和学习产生负面影响。毫无疑问，天天赶时髦不仅浪费时间，而且还消耗精力。如果公司和校方设立相关规定的话，员工和学生就必须穿着正式，从而不必过多在意他们的外表。例如，职业装是办公室职员的最佳选择。在多数情况下，校服是唯一被允许在校园内穿着的服装类型。这样，学生就无需考虑该如何穿得与众不同、美丽动人了。无论如何，办公室和校园是人们承担任务的场所，而非展现个人品位和衣服款式的地方。集中注意力对于提高工作和学习效率都是无比重要的。</p>
<p>此外，着装规定有助于展现良好的公共形象。作为重要的社会机构，企业和学校肩负着向公众展现其整体素质的责任。倘若每个人都有随意选择着装方式的自由，就可能会出现稀奇古怪的着装风格，这会严重损害整个组织的良好形象。奉行简朴保守的着装风格绝对是维系这些社会单位本色的最佳途径之一。</p>
<p>然而，工作和上学时遵守着装规定并不意味着全然拒绝时尚与美。每个社会成员都有美的权利。因此，设计师与服装厂商应该尽力将职业装或校服设计得更时尚、更美观。</p>
<p>总之，我们有充分的理由相信，制定保守着装规则有助于维持适宜的工作与学习氛围。遵循这些守则是公民的基本义务。同时，所有社会单位还应不遗余力地监督这些规定的顺利实施。只有这样，一个合理的环境才能真正建立起来。</p>

<h3><span id="58are-most-business-people-motivated-only-by-the-desire-for-money"> 58．Are most business people motivated only by the desire for money?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>Driven by the market-based economy, modern society has witnessed the <strong>formidable</strong> power of money. Not only business people, but also the whole working-class are joining in the endeavor for greater profits. Indeed, money isn’t everything but no one can do without it. As the major forces of economic and social development, enterprises <strong>are</strong> doubtlessly <strong>motivated by</strong> the desire to gain as much money as possible. However, it is unfair to <strong>assert</strong> that the pursuit of money is the only purpose of business people.</p>
<p>Firstly, the desire for money is the most fundamental <strong>initiative</strong> of most business people. This complies with basic economic laws. The <strong>preservation</strong> of capital is the <strong>prerequisite condition</strong> that sustains the survival of an <strong>enterprise</strong>. Therefore, in order to ensure the smooth operation of the entire organization, it is definitely reasonable for business people to attach great importance to profits. Only when a business is competent in making enough money can it continue to invigorate the market. Such a rule is typical in today’s market-based economy. If a company suffers losses <strong>consistently</strong>, it might face crisis and even <strong>bankruptcy</strong>. This will in turn produce negative impacts on the development of an economy as a whole. Consequently, the desire for money must be found in every business regardless of its <strong>scale</strong> and <strong>characteristics</strong>.</p>
<p>However, in spite of the essential pursuit of money, business people should never neglect social morality. It is extremely unwise to regard profit-making as an only motive. Admittedly, the earnest demand for gaining the largest profits possible sometimes might be contradictory to morals. In order to avoid losses and survive the <strong>harsh</strong> competition in the <strong>business arena</strong>, a number of business leaders are likely to come up with evil ideas. This explains the emergence of <strong>fake merchandise goods</strong> and exaggerated advertisements. What’s worse, some even conduct <strong>commercial fraud</strong>. Such <strong>excessive obsession with</strong> money-making may incur unhealthy competition and <strong>pose a threat to</strong> the fairness of the whole market. It will also tremendously harm the interest of consumers. Thus, all <strong>enterprises</strong> ought to be responsible social units that value morality.</p>
<p>Truthfully, the current social and economic conditions have ascertained the simple fact that beyond business people, people from all walks of life are motivated by the desire for money. As for ordinary citizens, unprecedented life pressure requires them to work diligently to <strong>make ends meet</strong>. <strong>Soaring prices</strong> of consumer goods, housing and other <strong>daily necessities</strong> urge people to consider money-making as a most crucial duty every day. Likewise, no matter how difficult the reality may be, all social members ought to be <strong>conscientious</strong> money-makers who never <strong>betray</strong> basic morals.</p>
<p>In sum, the business world is constructed on the foundation of profits. It is understandable for those who are engaged in such a field to embrace the desire to earn as much money as possible. Nonetheless, if the only intention of all business pursuits is for financial gains, society will not develop healthfully in the long run. Therefore, all professionals should maintain essential social morals before striving to make money.</p>

<p>58．大多数企业家只受金钱欲的驱使吗？</p>
<p>在市场经济的带动下，现代社会已经见证了金钱难以抗拒的威力。不仅是商人，整个工薪阶层都加入了“为更多盈利而战”的队伍之中。的确，金钱并非万能的，然而人们却无法离开它。作为经济和社会发展的主力军，企业无疑会受到利益的驱使，希望尽可能多地赚取利益。但是，认为追求金钱是商人唯一的目的是不公正的判断。</p>
<p>首先，赚钱是大多数商人的初衷。这符合基本的经济规律。资本积累是维持一个企业生存的前提条件。因此，为了保证整个机构的平稳运作，商人对利润的关注确实是合理的。只有当企业有能力挣得足够的钱时才能继续活跃在市场中。这是当今市场经济的典型规则。如果一个公司持续亏损，那么它有可能面临危机，甚至破产，继而对整体经济发展产生负面影响。因此，无论企业的大小与性质，它们对金钱的渴望都是存在的。</p>
<p>然而，尽管追求金钱是初衷，但商人不应忽视社会公德。将赚钱作为唯一的动机是极为不明智的。必须承认，有时候，对获得最大利益的热切需求可能与道德相悖。为了避免亏损并在商业圈残酷的竞争中生存，大量的企业领导者可能会产生邪恶的想法。这就解释了为何会出现假冒伪劣商品和夸大其词的广告。更有甚者，有些企业家甚至犯下商业欺诈罪。这种对赚钱的过分痴迷也许会引发不健康的竞争，并对整个市场的公平造成极大威胁，同时也会极大损害消费者的权益。因此，所有企业都应该成为遵守道德且有责任感的社会机构。</p>
<p>诚然，当前的社会和经济形势已经确定了一个简单的现实，那就是，除了商人，各行各业的人们都受到了金钱欲的驱使。对于普通百姓来说，前所未有的生活压力要求他们为生计奋力拼搏。高涨的物价和房价以及其他生活所需迫使其将挣钱作为每天最重要的任务。同样，无论现实有多么艰难，所有社会成员都应该成为有良心的劳动者，决不背离最基本的道德准则。</p>
<p>总之，商业界是建立在利润基础之上的。企业渴望赚取最大盈利是可以理解的。然而，如果他们唯一的意图仅仅是谋得经济利益的话，从长远来看，社会是无法健康发展下去的。因此，所有从业者都应该在努力赚钱的同时维持基本的社会公德。</p>

<h3><span id="59is-it-desirable-to-know-events-from-all-over-the-world"> 59．Is it desirable to know events from all over the world?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>The advanced network of mass media today has kept people <strong>well informed about</strong> what is going on in all corners of the earth. The world has been made smaller. Receiving updated reports from different nations and regions has become a fashionable habit of many people every day. Indeed, although many of these events are not directly associated with our daily lives, modern citizens ought to be encouraged to <strong>keep a close watch on</strong> them.</p>
<p>Above all, the world today has become a <strong>global village</strong>, where not a single nation is isolated from others. Chain effects exist in many aspects. These impacts are mostly <strong>recessive</strong> and thus cannot be <strong>sensed</strong> immediately. For instance, after browsing the reports about the global economy, people might learn the latest news about major foreign enterprises and the world market. In this modern age, the global market is <strong>a coherent whole</strong>. The financial crisis occurring in one region might be a reliable sign of an economic nightmare on a grander scale in the near future. Moreover, keeping an eye on world economic news is also helpful to those who have invested in the stock market. Policies issued by other nations might become a key factor of <strong>price fluctuations</strong> in one’s homeland. In addition to economics, <strong>regional conflicts</strong> or wars that take place faraway will remind people to avoid traveling to these places. Connections between countries nowadays have become tighter than before. Neglect of events in other nations might cause a person’s world understanding to be <strong>outdated</strong> and fall behind the rapid pace of global development.</p>
<p>Secondly, having access to information about the outside world is an effective step to broaden a person’s horizon. In a sense, learning about global events resembles <strong>setting off on</strong> a meaningful spiritual tour. Watching world-wide news broadcasts via the Internet or the TV, listening to global reports from the radio, reading articles in the world-news <strong>columns</strong> of newspapers and magazines; all these activities could be considerably beneficial to a person’s mental development. Thus, <strong>reserving</strong> a portion of leisure time for such an educational spiritual journey each day is undoubtedly a fashionable choice. After all, open-mindedness is a highly-desired quality in the modern era. Confinement and <strong>short-sightedness</strong> would definitely lead to the <strong>backwardness</strong> of an individual.</p>
<p>Last but not least, gaining knowledge about world-wide events helps people have a more rational understanding about what is happening in their home nations. Through comparison of current situations in different countries, viewers are blessed with the opportunity to obtain clearer comprehension of his motherland, and may begin to hold an objective attitude toward national events. Just as a famous ancient poem says, “<strong>We cannot see</strong> <strong>the true colors of Lu Mountain only because we are in it</strong>.” Indeed, knowing about diverse global events brings a person into the outside world and allows him to observe his own country from a new angle. Moreover, in such a process, <strong>unwanted</strong> prejudices might be diminished and differences between countries might be accepted as well.</p>
<p>Consequently, in order to become qualified inhabitants in this global village, sensible individuals should cover a wide range of information by taking advantage of mass media. Meanwhile, it is imperative to form an objective attitude toward what is happening both at home and abroad and learn to <strong>seek truth from facts</strong>.</p>

<p>59．了解全世界发生的事件有必要吗？</p>
<p>如今，大众媒介发达的网络使人们对地球上每个角落发生的事都了如指掌。世界变得越来越小了。接收来自不同国家和地区的最新报道已经成为很多人每天的时尚习惯。的确，尽管许多事件与我们的日常生活并没有直接联系，但仍然应该鼓励现代公民密切关注时事。</p>
<p>首先，当今世界已经变成了一个地球村，任何国家都不是孤立的。连锁效应在多方面都存在。这些影响大都具有隐秘性，因此无法立即被觉察到。例如，在浏览了有关全球经济的报道之后，人们也许会了解到国外主要企业以及世界市场的最新消息。在这个现代化的时代，全球市场是一个相互关联的整体。在一个地区发生的经济危机也许是未来更大规模经济危机的可靠信号。此外，关注世界经济新闻还对股票投资者有所帮助。其他国家发布的政策也许会成为自己国家价格波动的关键因素之一。除了经济领域之外，发生在遥远国度的地区冲突或战争会提醒人们避免去那些地方旅游。现在，国家之间的联系比从前更加紧密了。忽视他国的新闻会使一个人的世界观变得过时，并落后于全球发展的飞快脚步。</p>
<p>其次，获取外界信息是拓宽视野的有效方法。在某种意义上，了解全球事件如同进行一次有意义的精神之旅。通过互联网或电视观看国际新闻报道，或收听全球广播报道，或阅读报纸杂志的世界新闻专栏的文章，这些对一个人的心理发展都是极为有益的。因此，每天留出一部分休闲时间进行如此有教育意义的旅行无疑是时尚的选择。毕竟，开阔的思想是这个年代高度推崇的品质，而缺乏远见的狭隘思想必定会导致个人的落后。</p>
<p>最后，了解世界各地的事件有助于人们更理性地理解自己国家发生的事。通过对比不同国家的当前形势，旁观者便可获得对自己祖国更清晰的认识，并且开始对国内事件持有客观的态度。正如一首著名古诗所云：“不识庐山真面目，只缘身在此山中。”的确，了解多种多样的全球事件使人们置身世外，从崭新的视角观察自己的国家。此外，在这个过程中，还有可能消除不必要的偏见，同时国与国之间的差异也更容易被接受。</p>
<p>因此，为了能够成为这个地球村里合格的居民，明智的个人应该利用大众媒介获取广泛的信息。与此同时，人们还需对国内外事件持有客观的态度，并学会一切从实际出发。</p>

<h3><span id="60children-should-not-be-allowed-to-play-computer-games"> 60．Children should not be allowed to play computer games?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>Unlike older generation, children today become familiar with computers at a very early age. <strong>Tactfully-designed</strong> computer games are extremely popular among the young. Supported by <strong>digital technology and</strong> <strong>multimedia</strong>, such games are leading children into a magical <strong>wonderland</strong>. Many parents complain that playing computer games is totally a waste of time and so never allow their children to use them. As far as I am concerned, not all computer games are harmful.</p>
<p>Admittedly, it is not advisable for children to be overly obsessed with computer games. Most computer games boast a large number of elements that are dramatically appealing to the hearts of children. <strong>True-to-life</strong> visual and sound effects combined with smartly-designed plots and <strong>fascinating</strong> game modes allow participants to vividly experience the magical power of the electronic world. Owing to these superior characteristics, most computer games are able to tie an addicted youngster to the chair before the computer screen for a long time. Without doubt, it will not only do harm to a child’s health and schoolwork, but also waste much valuable time that could be spent engaging in more meaningful activities. Concrete evidence can be seen in many families nowadays. The sevenyear-old son of my cousin used to be so addicted to computer games that he would consume half of his weekend in front of the computer. As time went by, he became <strong>nearsighted</strong> and his studies were also negatively affected. As soon as his parents realized the potential threat of computer games, they had to set strict rules that <strong>prohibit</strong> their child <strong>from</strong> playing them too often.</p>
<p>However, in spite of the side effects computer games bring to children, there are also some positive qualities hidden in them that could possibly be beneficial. To illustrate, some <strong>puzzle games</strong> are designed to train a person’s logical thinking and urge him to use his <strong>wits</strong>. Children are at an age of mental development. Using such games may be a good approach to exercise the brain. With this in mind, parents could allow their children to spend some time solving interesting puzzles on the computer. In addition, some educational computer games <strong>familiarize</strong> children <strong>with</strong> practical skills or useful knowledge. A popular game named <em>RichMan</em>, for example, guides players to plan and arrange <strong>incomes</strong> and investments intelligently. Young children can obtain a primary understanding of what financial transactions mean.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, it is the responsibility of parents to manage and control the time their children spend playing computer games and help them <strong>select</strong> the most suitable types of games. In most cases, children are too young to have enough awareness of time. They are also unable to distinguish between good and bad. With the support and <strong>guidance</strong> from their parents, children are likely to benefit much from using computer games.</p>
<p>Therefore, even though being addicted to computer games does harm to children’s health and <strong>interrupts</strong> their schoolwork, there is no need to label this form of <strong>leisure activity</strong> totally meaningless. Through some computer games, children can be offered an opportunity to exercise their brains and train themselves to become smarter and more <strong>capable</strong>. As long as they are under the guidance and supervision of parents, children should be allowed to play some computer games.</p>

<p>60．不应该允许孩子们玩电脑游戏吗？</p>
<p>与长辈们不同，现在的孩子们在很小的时候就对电脑很熟悉了。设计精妙的电脑游戏极受他们的欢迎。这些由数码科技和多媒体技术打造的游戏将孩子们带入一个神奇的世界。很多家长都抱怨说玩电脑游戏纯粹是浪费时间，所以不允许孩子用电脑。在我看来，并非所有的电脑游戏都是有害的。</p>
<p>不能否认，孩子们不应过度沉迷于电脑游戏。大部分电脑游戏中都含有很多对青少年心灵极有吸引力的元素。逼真的视觉和声音效果，加之巧妙构思的场景以及引人入胜的游戏模式，使得玩家得以生动体验电子世界的神奇魔力。由于这些优越的特点，大多数电脑游戏都能让着迷的孩子在屏幕前坐很长时间。毋庸置疑，这不仅对其健康和学业有害，还浪费了很多应用在更多有意义活动之上的宝贵时间。在当今许多家庭中都有这样的实例。我表哥7岁的儿子曾经迷上了电脑游戏，在周末，他有一半的时间都待在电脑前。渐渐地，他的眼睛近视了，学习也受到了不好的影响。当他的父母意识到电脑游戏的潜在危害时，他们不得不定下严格的规矩以免他玩得过多。</p>
<p>然而，尽管电脑游戏会给孩子带来负面影响，但其也隐含一些可能使孩子受益的特性。例如，有的猜谜游戏为训练人的逻辑思维而设计，并促使其开动脑筋。青少年正处于智力发育阶段，这些游戏可作为训练大脑的好方法。鉴于这点，父母可以允许孩子花一些时间在电脑上玩有趣的猜谜游戏。此外，具有教育意义的电脑游戏使孩子们熟悉一些实用的技能和有用知识。比如有一个名叫《大富翁》的流行游戏引导玩家对收入和投资进行精明的计划安排。孩子们能够获得对金融交易的意义的初步了解。</p>
<p>实际上，父母有责任管理和控制孩子玩游戏的时间，并帮他们选择最适合的游戏种类。在多数情况下，孩子年纪太小，时间意识不够强，也无法辨别好与坏。有了父母的支持与指导，他们就有可能从玩游戏中受益。</p>
<p>因此，尽管沉迷于电脑游戏对孩子的健康有害且耽误他们的学习，却没有必要将这种休闲活动全盘否定。通过玩一些电脑游戏，孩子们可以获得训练大脑的良机，从而变得更加聪明能干。只要是在家长的引导和监督之下，应当允许孩子们玩一些电脑游戏。</p>

<h3><span id="61people-buy-things-not-because-they-need-them-but-because-others-buy-them"> 61．People buy things not because they need them, but because others buy them?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>For years, <strong>psychologists</strong> have conducted much research on people’s <strong>conformist mentality</strong>, especially on the consumer’s market. A controversial discussion emerges concerning people’s temptation to buy things. Some experts believe that the motive of consumers’ purchases <strong>is</strong> often <strong>intimately associated with</strong> others’ intentions to buy them rather than their own need. In the mean time there is also a completely <strong>opposite voice</strong>, <strong>defending</strong> the notion that the most essential motivation to buy is <strong>nothing but</strong> necessity. According to my standpoint, people buy things on the basis of need, but may also be easily influenced by others.</p>
<p>In most cases, purchases are made owing to the buyers’ basic needs. Just as the <strong>economists</strong> define, the value of all <strong>items</strong> traded on the market is primarily determined by people’s demand. It is due to people’s need that <strong>common objects</strong> are turned into <strong>commodities</strong>. A recent survey conducted by the Consumers’ Association indicates that 60% of the customers wandering inside department stores or supermarkets are shopping for goods that they need. Actually, in the eyes of many consumers, no matter how good the quality of a commodity appears to be and no matter how <strong>exquisite</strong> its appearance is, if it is not what they need, it would become <strong>insignificant</strong>. After all, not everyone is wealthy enough to <strong>take possession of</strong> all the good things on display in the market. Only those that are useful prove to be the most worthwhile to the majority of potential buyers.</p>
<p>Admittedly, some consumers tend to <strong>follow suit</strong> and buy things they might not be in need of. We could naturally come up with the familiar scene in the shops where crowds of people are gathering around to pay for a target commodity. Whenever such a situation occurs, some people possibly could not help themselves joining in this group. Under such circumstances, people seem to <strong>keep a blind eye to</strong> whatever the others are pursuing. It is the psychological feedback that unconsciously guides them to approach such a hot shopping spot and finally surrender to the powerful trend.</p>
<p>In effect, regarding people’s different intentions of buying things, a number of other major factors should be taken into consideration as well. These may include lower prices or discounts of certain merchandise goods in large <strong>shopping malls,</strong> personal preferences, investment and collection of valuables and so on. Each one of them could make people take out their <strong>wallets</strong> to pay. As a consequence, in order to avoid wasting money on needless commodities, consumers should strive to form a good habit of rational consumptions. That is to say, in the face of overwhelming purchasing passion of others, one should keep a clear mind and be self-conscious of his own actions.</p>
<p>To sum up, people with different characters may behave differently before paying for a product. Some consumers are blindly following suit when shopping for goods. By contrast, some only buy whatever they need. In fact, only rational consumption is highly desired. Otherwise people would go back home with <strong>a large quantity of</strong> objects they might not really wish to obtain.</p>

<p>61．人们买东西并非因为需要，而是由于别人也买？</p>
<p>近年来，心理学家对人们的从众心理，尤其在消费者市场上的从众心理方面进行了大量研究。人们购买行为的诱因引发了颇具争议的讨论。有些专家认为消费者的购买动机通常与他人的购买意图密切相关，而并非出于自己的需要。同时，也有截然相反的观点，认为人们购物的最根本动因不是别的，正是需要。在我看来，人们是在需要的基础上购买的，但也有可能轻易受到他人的影响。</p>
<p>在多数情况下，人们购买是由于基本需要。正如经济学家所定义的那样，所有在市场上交易商品的价值主要是由消费者的需求决定的。正是人们的需要使普通物品成为了商品。最近，一项由消费者协会发起的调查显示，在逛商场或超市的人群中，有60％的人在购买他们所需要的东西。其实在很多消费者的眼里，无论商品的质量有多高，外观有多精美，只要不是其所必需，就变得不重要了。毕竟不是所有的人都富得可以把市场上陈列的好东西都占为己有。对于大多数潜在消费者来说，有用的才是最有价值的。</p>
<p>不可否认，有的消费者倾向于跟风购买一些并不需要的东西。我们会不由地想起商店里熟悉的场景，大群人拥挤在一起抢购目标商品。每当遇到这种场合时，有些人也许会不由自主地也加入其中。在这种情况下，人们似乎对于他人所争抢的任何东西都失去了判断力。正是这样的心理反应引导他们不知不觉地接近如此火热的狂购大潮，并最终在强大的感召力面前屈服。</p>
<p>事实上，对于人们购物的多种意图，我们还应顾及其他主要因素，这包括低廉的价格、大型购物中心某些商品的打折销售、个人偏好、奢侈品的投资与收藏等。其中任何一点都可能使人们打开自己的钱包。因此，为了防止把钱花在不需要的东西上，消费者应当努力养成理性消费的好习惯。也就是说，在其他人势不可挡的购物热面前应当保持清醒的头脑，并且控制好自己的行为。</p>
<p>总之，不同性格的人在购物之前的举动也许不同。有些消费者购物时会盲目地跟风，相反，有些人只买需要的。其实只有理性消费才是可取的。否则，人们也许会带回家一大堆他们原来根本不想要的东西。</p>

<h3><span id="62is-university-education-the-most-important-factor-in-a-persons-success"> 62．Is university education the most important factor in a person’s success?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>As is vastly acknowledged, the precious years spent in the university deserve a person’s lifelong cherishment. Higher education doubtlessly <strong>constitutes</strong> a crucial stage during the long journey toward shining success. In spite of this, receiving a college degree only <strong>symbolizes</strong> one’s primary academic achievement and the early <strong>maturity</strong> of his personality. Therefore, I would rather prefer to regard university education as a stepping stone toward success rather than the most important factor.</p>
<p>In the first place, we shall never deny the important role higher learning plays in a person’s self-development. It is a special period of time before a young adult enters the society and finally turns himself into a <strong>qualified</strong> and responsible social member. Thus, all the knowledge, skills <strong>along with</strong> the precious life experience accumulated inside this <strong>ivory tower</strong> would produce far-reaching influences on a person’s future endeavors toward success. To illustrate, unlike <strong>preliminary education</strong> that emphasizes largely on the most fundamental theories in the textbooks, university education provides more opportunities for the students to put what has been learned into practice and guides them to seek truth from the facts. Tutors are allowing independent thinking and give their students more freedom to express personal opinions. Finally, <strong>equipped with</strong> specialized skills <strong>grasped</strong> in the university, graduates would have greater confidence to begin the next stage of life.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is too absolute to define university education as the most important factor in a person’s success. Other crucial elements should also be stressed. The world today is filled with <strong>eminent</strong> figures who have never received a university degree but become <strong>astoundingly</strong> successful. Among them, Bill Gates, the richest man on earth, should be brought into the <strong>limelight</strong>. He entered Harvard in 1973 but quit school two years later to set up Microsoft, which has <strong>taken</strong> the IT industry <strong>by storm</strong> and dominates the PC market with its operating systems. His brilliant success owes much to his inner qualities, including wisdom, a strong will, self-confidence, creativity and above all, his everlasting diligence. Evidently, all these critical qualities could be found in each successful talent.</p>
<p>Indeed, education is a life-long process and every stage possesses its unique significance. Ever since one’s birth, his education has begun. Parents could be considered as the first teachers who render enlightening knowledge to their child. Later, formal education is received from the <strong>kindergarten</strong> and the primary school. During this period, teachers help children <strong>comprehend</strong> common sense and lead them to learn the most basic theories. As soon as a person arrives at the high school age, richer knowledge could be gained and more skills could be grasped. Doubtlessly, preliminary education prepares a person for the new stage of life in the university. Even when one graduates from the university, education is still to be continued <strong>at work</strong>. Just as the old saying goes, “You’re never too old to learn”. As a result, not only university education, but also education in other periods, could be equally important factors that make a person succeed.</p>
<p>To conclude, the opportunity to receive higher education instills endless happiness into a person’s life. Such a meaningful experience also paves the way to his success in the future. Nevertheless, if other important factors are neglected, obtaining a university <strong>diploma</strong> is far from enough to reach the target. Only through unremitting efforts and the <strong>iron determination</strong> to learn even after graduation could it be possible for a person to become successful at last.</p>

<p>62．大学教育是个人成功的最重要因素吗？</p>
<p>在大学里度过的那几年宝贵的时光值得终生珍藏，这是人们普遍认同的。毋庸置疑，高等教育是通往辉煌成功漫漫路途中至关重要的阶段。然而，获得大学学位仅仅代表学业初有成果，以及性格刚刚开始成熟。因此，我更愿意认为大学教育仅仅是通向成功的基石，而不是最重要的因素。</p>
<p>首先，我们不能否认高等教育对个人发展的重要。这是一段特殊的时期，在此之后，年轻人就将踏入社会并最终使自己成为合格且有责任感的社会成员了。因此，所有在这座象牙塔里积累的知识、技能以及宝贵的生活经验将对一个人未来为成功的拼搏产生深远影响。具体来说，大学教育与初级教育不同，初级教育的重点大都在课本里的最基础理论之上，而大学教育则提供给学生更多将所学知识应用于实践的机会，并且引导其实事求是。导师允许学生进行独立的思考，并且给予他们更多抒发自己个人见解的自由。最终，由于具备了在大学中掌握的专业技能，毕业生会在最终踏入崭新人生阶段时更有信心。</p>
<p>然而，认为大学教育是个人成功最重要的因素就未免过于绝对了。其他关键的因素也应得到重视。世界上有很多名人虽然并没有大学学位，却获得了惊人的成功。其中，全球首富比尔·盖茨应当成为我们关注的焦点。他在1973年进入哈佛大学，然而却在2年后退学并创办了微软公司。微软以其操作系统占领了个人电脑市场并在信息技术行业掀起了浪潮。他辉煌的成功与很多内在素质有很大关系，包括智慧、坚强的意志、自信、创新力以及最重要的一点，那就是不懈的努力。不言而喻，这些重要的品质是每位成功人才都必备的。</p>
<p>的确，教育是可持续一生的进程，每个阶段都有其独特的意义。一个人的教育从呱呱坠地之时开始。父母可视为给孩子提供启蒙教育的首位老师。之后，在幼儿园和小学接受正规的教育，此时老师帮助孩子们理解常识，并且指引他们学习最基础的理论。当一个人到了上中学的年龄时，就可以获得更丰富的知识，掌握更多的技能。毋庸置疑，初级教育为迎接崭新的大学生活做了准备。即便大学毕业之后，教育依然在工作岗位上继续进行。正如一句格言所述，“活到老，学到老。”因此，不仅大学教育，其他阶段的教育也同样是使一个人成功的重要因素。</p>
<p>总之，能够有机会接受高等教育为人生注入了无穷的快乐，如此有意义的经历也为将来的成功铺平了道路。然而，如果忽视了其他因素的话，获得大学文凭对于达到目标是远远不够的。一个人只有通过坚持不懈的努力以及大学毕业后继续保持的学习意志才能最终收获成功。</p>

<h3><span id="63shouldnt-people-be-permitted-to-use-mobile-phones-on-public-transportation-vehicles"> 63．Shouldn’t people be permitted to use mobile phones on public transportation vehicles?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>The prosperity of modern technology is being exhibited in almost all corners of society nowadays. An outstanding <strong>representative</strong> in this <strong>digital</strong> age could be the prevalent mobile phones. With the number of cell phone owners reaching to an unprecedented height, no one shall deny the powerful role this tiny communication <strong>device</strong> plays. Recently, a controversial proposal was <strong>put forward</strong>, suggesting that the use of mobile phones be prohibited on buses, trains or airplanes. In my opinion, not all public vehicles should issue such mobile phone bans.</p>
<p>First of all, due to safety concerns, mobile phones should not be allowed to use on airplanes. According to the current <strong>air traffic rules</strong>, all passengers are required to <strong>switch off</strong> their mobile phones before the plane takes off. People are required to learn the basic common sense that signals emitted from mobile phones might <strong>interfere with</strong> the <strong>air route</strong> signals sent from the airport. Moreover, important messages are also being delivered from the plane operating system to the <strong>ground stations</strong>. If passengers are making phone calls when the fight is in the air, those signals might <strong>instigate</strong> potential threats. Indeed, airplanes belong to the type of vehicles that require the highest level of security. Not only the <strong>crew members</strong>, but also every traveler on the plane, should join hands to ensure safety. Anyhow, it is a matter of life and death which relies on individual responsibility.</p>
<p>On the contrary, passengers deserve the right to use mobile phones in other public vehicles, including buses, trains and subways. Unlike the situation on the airplanes, the use of mobile phones would not affect the communication. Drivers could never be <strong>distracted</strong> by mobile phone signals. Thus, driving safety can be well ensured. Admittedly, the most <strong>typical feature</strong> of cell phones is their <strong>mobility</strong> and their most important function is to support convenient communication between people. Suppose mobile phones are prohibited on buses or trains, troubles might be aroused when emergency situations occur. In a sense, it’s under these circumstances that mobile phones can be utilized. People could not merely remain connected to their family and friends while traveling, but could benefit from the recreational functions of mobile phones as well, like the music player and the Internet. Therefore, there is absolutely no need to limit the use of mobile phones on these public vehicles.</p>
<p>In spite of the fact that mobile phones could be used on some vehicles, users have the obligation to obey public rules and follow the <strong>social norms</strong>. That is to say, while making calls via cell phones, people should <strong>be fully</strong> <strong>aware of</strong> their surroundings and make sure that others will not be disturbed, especially when other passengers are <strong>taking a nap</strong> or reading books. Furthermore, all drivers are the special group of people who should never turn on their mobile phones while operating a vehicle.</p>
<p>Consequently, in order to curb the potential side effects mobile phones may bring to people’s daily life, certain measures need to be adopted and strictly enforced, including the prohibition of mobile phone uses on airplanes. Even though in some public transportation vehicles passengers could be allowed to use mobile phones, yet there are still a number of essential rules for all social members to obey. After all, safety and morality always comes before mobility.</p>

<p>63．应当禁止人们在公共交通工具上使用手机吗？</p>
<p>现代科技的繁荣在几乎社会的各个角落都有所体现。在这个数字时代一个显著代表就是手机的普及。随着手机用户的数量达到了空前的高度，没人能够否认这个微小通信设备所产生的强大影响。最近，出现了一个颇具争议的观点，观点称，应当在公车、火车、飞机上禁用手机。我认为，并非所有的公共交通工具都需要对手机实施禁令。</p>
<p>首先，出于对安全的考虑，应当在飞机上禁止使用手机。根据现行航空规定，所有旅客必须在飞机起飞之前将手机关闭。人们理应了解基本的常识，即手机信号会干扰从机场发出的导航信号，此外，飞机操作系统也会向地面站发送重要的信息。倘若乘客在飞机飞行时打手机，手机讯号可能引发潜在的威胁。的确，飞机是需要达到最高级别安全标准的交通工具。机组人员以及每位乘客应共同确保安全。毕竟这是生死攸关的事，需要依靠每个人的责任。</p>
<p>然而，乘客应该享有在公车、火车、地铁等其他公共交通工具上用手机的权利。与飞机上的情况不同，使用手机不会影响地面通讯，司机也不会受到手机信号的干扰。因此，行车安全可以得到保证。不能否认，便携性是手机最典型的特点，其最重要功能是协助人们进行方便的沟通。假设手机在公车或火车上被禁用，那么，当遇到紧急情况时就会产生麻烦。从某个角度而言，手机正是在此类状况下发挥作用的。人们不仅可以在乘车时与家人和朋友保持联系，而且还能从手机的娱乐功能中获益，如音乐播放器和互联网。因此，完全没必要在这些公共交通工具上禁用手机。</p>
<p>尽管在一些交通工具上可以允许用手机，人们仍然有义务遵守公共秩序和社会准则。也就是说，在用手机打电话时，应当特别留心周围的环境以确保他人不受到打扰，尤其是其他客正在打盹儿或阅读的时候。另外，所有司机在驾驶车辆时是绝对不能开手机的。</p>
<p>因此，为了抑制手机可能产生的潜在的负面影响，应当采取并严厉执行某些措施，包括禁止在飞机上用手机。虽然在某些公共交通工具上可以允许使用手机，但所有的社会成员仍须遵守最基本的行为准则。无论如何，安全与道德永远先于便利性。</p>

<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>Natural sciences and liberal arts constitute two major branches of studies in <strong>institutions of higher learning</strong> today. As soon as high school students are admitted into the university, they are assigned to academic courses and begin to focus his or her own major. Some educators <strong>promote</strong> that regardless of the distinctive fields of studies, university students should be required to take basic science courses. Personally speaking, I am willing to express my support to such a proposal.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, all fields of studies are <strong>interrelated</strong> and supportive of each other. Students of liberal arts need to learn the basic knowledge of science. To further illustrate, the ability to think logically is what they could gain from such science subjects as <strong>advanced mathematics</strong>. Art students could take advantage of these courses to train their brains. The ability to think logically may be made the best use of in their future academic and career life. Besides, courses on computer science familiarize students with the <strong>cardinal principles</strong> of the computer systems. They are also taught the essential <strong>techniques</strong> to operate computers. Without doubt, the <strong>mastery</strong> of computer skills is critical in the information age. Therefore, these basic science courses are worthwhile for art students, for they contribute much to the enhancement of their individual qualities.</p>
<p>In addition, taking science courses makes the campus life more colorful and interesting. The magical world of science is filled with mysteries. The process of solving scientific problems simply resembles going on an enjoyable tour. <strong>Taking in</strong> fresh concepts in the field of science also renders to the students a strong sense of fulfillment and happiness. Doing fascinating scientific experiments could be another fortunate privilege offered to art students who <strong>are</strong> often <strong>short of</strong> such experience in their own field of study. <strong>In a word</strong>, through the participation of science courses, students <strong>are led into</strong> a wonderland which is full of <strong>miracles</strong> and joy. Thus, the years spent at college will become extremely fruitful and unforgettable.</p>
<p>Last, the modern world has an increasing demand of <strong>talents with comprehensive skills</strong>. Even though students majoring in other fields might not be able to probe deeper into science, the primary theories and skills encompassed in those basic courses would doubtlessly help them stand out as capable talents. In the competitive society, only those with <strong>a broader command of</strong> knowledge have better chances to win.</p>
<p>In conclusion, with the aim to cultivate a larger group of competent individuals, school authorities should encourage their students to actively participate in a vast range of courses, including basic science. There exists no absolute barrier among all school subjects. Covering diversified areas of knowledge and mastering extensive skills will tremendously benefit those who dream of a fruitful and successful future.</p>

<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>The construction of superior-quality human resources is critical to a company’s sustainable development. As for an enterprise with a larger scale of <strong>working staff</strong>, investing in <strong>personnel training</strong> is particularly necessary and rewarding. Undeniably, so long as the overall ability of employees is enhanced to a higher degree, more profits might be gained and <strong>productivity</strong> can be improved at the same time. Therefore, it is a wise choice for company leaders to allocate a portion of <strong>capitals</strong> on human resource improvement. Meanwhile, other significant investments should also be made.</p>
<p>To begin with, the working efficiency of employees is of <strong>irreplaceable</strong> significance to the <strong>survival</strong> and prosperity of a large enterprise. In reality, as each company has its unique cultural background and values, the <strong>work allocations</strong> in different companies are supposed to differ <strong>extensively</strong>. Every post within a business requires some special skills and knowledge that must not have been mastered before. Thereafter, it is imperative to start formal training courses to make him fully qualified to perform his assigned tasks. According to a news report in the famous journal named <em>Business World</em>, the salary level of <strong>certified enterprise trainers</strong> has been raised due to the increasing demand of large companies which attach great importance to the ability enhancement of their working staff. This vividly indicates that the abilities of employees are closely associated with the general interests of an entire enterprise. From this angle, the investment is absolutely practical.</p>
<p>On the part of the employees, obtaining an opportunity to improve their abilities would motivate them to devote more time to their work and teach them to cooperate with the <strong>co-workers</strong>. Undeniably, enthusiasm is just like a magical stimulus that fills a person with endless energy and helps him perform better in their positions. The <strong>generous</strong> offer of in-service education by the company may possibly spark an employee’s learning and working passion. A strong sense of self-consciousness would urge them to work more diligently so as to prove that the company’s investment has not been <strong>ineffectively</strong> made. On the other hand, during the course of training, the employees would also realize the importance of teamwork and are motivated to <strong>join hands with</strong> their colleagues to make greater contributions to the company.</p>
<p>In fact, there are also other aspects that deserve the company’s attention and investment. For instance, a large amount of money should be invested in enterprise <strong>promotion</strong>, including producing TV or magazine advertisements, making donations to <strong>social welfare</strong> as well as taking part in diversified commercial activities. <strong>Despite</strong> the high costs, all these investments are supposed to be rewarding, for they would help <strong>lift a company’s image</strong> before the public. Besides, the <strong>perfection</strong> of a comprehensive enterprise welfare system is another important investment that should not be <strong>omitted</strong> by any wise company leaders.</p>
<p>To sum up, in-service education is of essential importance to both the employers and employees. As the major force of a big company’s further development, employees <strong>at all levels</strong> should be competent enough to perform their assigned duties. Therefore, in order to ensure the general working efficiency and maintain a positive working atmosphere, investment should be made to improve the abilities of staff members.</p>

<p>65．对大公司来说最重要的投资</p>
<p>打造高素质的员工队伍对一个公司的可持续发展至关重要。对于一个人员众多的企业来说，在员工培训上的投资是极其有必要的，也是很值得的。毋庸置疑，只要雇员的整体能力有所提高，企业就会赢得更多的利润，同时生产率也会改善。因此，将一部分资金投入到改善人力资源之中是公司领导者的明智选择。同时，其他重大投资也不应被忽视。</p>
<p>首先，员工的工作效率对一个大企业的生存与强盛起着不可替代的作用。实际上，由于每家公司拥有其独特的文化背景与理念，不同公司的工作分配也有所不同。企业内的每一个职位都需要之前未能掌握的特殊技能与知识。因此，启动正式的培训课程以使每个人都能完全胜任其职责是势在必行的。据知名周刊《商业大世界》的一篇报道，由于重视提高员工能力的大公司对企业培训的需求增加了，注册企业培训师的薪酬水平随之上涨。这生动地表明，员工的能力与整个企业的整体利益息息相关。从此角度来看，投资员工培训绝对是务实的。</p>
<p>对员工向言，他们获得了提高自己能力的机会，这不仅促使他们将更多的时间用在工作上，而且还能教会他们如何与同事合作。很显然，工作热情就如同一种神奇的推动力，使人充满了无限能量，并助其在工作岗位上表现出色。公司慷慨提供在职培训可能会激发员工工作和学习的热情。一种强烈的自我意识会促使他们更加勤奋地工作，以此来证明公司的投资并不是无效的。另一方面，在接受培训期间，员工也能意识到团队协作的重要性，并获得与同事齐心为公司作出更大贡献的动力。</p>
<p>其实，还有其他几方面也值得公司的关注与投资。例如，应该在企业推广上投入大量的资金，其中包括制作电视和杂志广告、捐助社会福利事业以及参加多种商业活动。尽管这些投资数额巨大，但是是有回报的，因为公司在公众面前的形象得到了提升。除此之外，完善全面的企业福利系统也是一笔重要投资，所有精明的领导者都不应对其懈怠。</p>
<p>总之，在职教育对于雇主与雇员双方都十分重要。作为大型公司进一步发展的主要力量，各阶层员工都应当有足够的能力胜任自己的职责。因此，为了确保整体工作效率，并维系良好的工作氛围，公司理应为提高员工能力投资。</p>

<h3><span id="66are-people-now-easier-to-become-educated-than-in-the-past"> 66．Are people now easier to become educated than in the past?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>In the face of the <strong>multi-channels</strong> of education today, people no longer limit themselves to the most traditional way to learn. Attending classes and reading books used to be the only method for an individual to become <strong>knowledgeable</strong> and well-educated. With the society advancing into the information age, more diversified means of learning are available for those who intend to eliminate their <strong>illiteracy</strong>. Indeed, it has become much easier for people to become educated than before.</p>
<p>First of all, advanced technology has made it easier for people to teach themselves at home. Thanks to the tremendous impacts of the information age, endless sources of education are provided through the broad network of mass media. Such intelligent devices like computers and other digital tools are easy to operate and thus could <strong>sustain</strong> people to complete <strong>self-taught courses</strong> in many fields. With simple clicks of the mouse, the learning process could begin and run smoothly at home. For instance, a rich supply of <strong>online classes</strong> helps create a vivid classroom atmosphere for the students. By following each step of instructions on the websites, knowledge could be gained and skills could be accumulated. Furthermore, useful reading materials could be downloaded and installed in portable digital readers. People no longer have to borrow printed books from the library or purchase piles of heavy books from the bookstores. Reading has become more convenient and access to <strong>a wide range of</strong> books is easier than ever. Besides, communication tools could be made full use of for learners to <strong>exchange ideas with</strong> their classmates and <strong>tutors</strong> online. This would definitely ensure studying efficiency.</p>
<p>In addition to the diversified channels of self-study, people today are also blessed with numerous choices of school education. More freedom is rendered to all the social members who could make their own learning plans and a larger variety of schools and courses are available for them to choose. Thus, contrary to the past when the <strong>backward</strong> education system hindered many earnest students from furthering their studies, there is no need to worry about the possible loss of opportunities to receive formal education. To illustrate, the admission to institutions of higher learning has been made easier due to the <strong>enlarged enrollment</strong>. Public schools run by the government are not the only choice for many people. With the development of private schools and the easier entrance into overseas universities, students are given better chances to pursue their studies. Also, an increasing number of <strong>vocational</strong> <strong>schools</strong> and training classes are also joining in the mighty forces of the modern education network.</p>
<p>By contrast, it was more difficult for people to become educated in the past. Take China for example, during the ancient time, women were not allowed to attend schools. Their destined role was supposed to be <strong>housewives</strong>. Just as an old saying goes, <strong>innocence is the virtue of women</strong>. Equality of learning was extremely hard to achieve. <strong>Sex discrimination</strong> in education used to be a major factor that made <strong>intelligent</strong> ladies illiterate. In the <strong>revolutionary period</strong>, although women were offered the chance to learn, the shortage of schools and the comparatively stricter admission also made it impossible for all the citizens to receive education. In a word, the backwardness of society hindered many people from becoming educated during the old days.</p>
<p>Indeed, people are fortunate enough to gain easier access to different forms of education today. Due to the greater demand of well-educated talents, it is imperative for the government to enhance the general knowledge level of people by creating an advanced education system. Looking back on the difficult past, every individual should cherish the freer learning environment this new era has created.</p>

<p>66．现在，人们接受教育比过去容易吗？</p>
<p>在当今多渠道的教育面前，人们不再拘泥于最传统的学习方式。过去，上课和读书是一个人变得有学识、有文化的唯一途径。随着社会进入信息时代，更多样化的学习方法供那些志在给自己扫盲的人们去选择。的确，比起从前，人们更容易受教育了。</p>
<p>首先，高科技使人们更方便地在家里自学。由于信息时代所产生的巨大影响，无穷无尽的教育资源通过大众媒介宽广的网络传播开来。诸如电脑和其他数码工具之类的智能设备操作简便，因此可以帮助人们完成多领域的自学课程。只需轻点鼠标，学习过程就能在家里开始并顺利进行了。比如说，丰富多彩的网上课堂为学生营造了生动的教室氛围。跟随网站上提供的每个步骤便可获取知识并积累技能。此外，还可下载有用的阅读资料，然后将其安装至便携式数码阅读器上。人们不必再从图书馆借阅纸质书籍，或从书店购买一堆堆厚重的书了。读书变得更加方便，而且人们可以更轻易地阅读更多种类的书。另外，通过充分利用交流工具，学生之间以及师生之间可以在网上沟通，这的确能保证学习效率。</p>
<p>除了多渠道自学之外，现在的人们也拥有多种学校教育的选择权。社会给予所有可以自己制订学习计划的成员更大的自由空间，有多种类的学校和课程可供挑选。因此，这不同于过去，那时，落后的教育体系使很多渴望学习的人停止了深造的脚步，而如今，人们不必再担心失去接受正规教育的机会了。具体来说，由于扩招的缘故，被高校录取变得更加容易。政府公办的学校不再是多数人的唯一选择。随着民办院校的发展以及海外大学门槛的拓宽，学生们有了更好的求学深造机会。另外，越来越多的职业学校及培训课程也融入到了现代教育网络庞大的队伍之中。</p>
<p>对比而言，在过去，人们受教育的难度更大。以中国古代为例，那时的女子是不能上学的。当家庭主妇是她们的天职。正如古时一句俗语所述，女子无才便是德。学习的平等权是极难达到的。教育方面的性别歧视是使聪慧女子没有文化的主要因素。在革命时期，尽管女子有上学的机会，但学校的缺少以及相对严格的录取也使全民受教育无法实现。简言之，社会的落后阻碍过去的人们接受良好的教育。</p>
<p>能够以不同的方式受教育，现在的人们的确很幸运。由于对有文化人才的需求增加，政府应当通过建立一个发达的教育体系来提高人民的整体知识水平。回顾艰难的过去，每个人都应珍惜这个新时代营造的更加自由的学习环境。</p>

<h3><span id="67choosing-friends-that-have-fun-with-or-that-help-you-when-you-need-them"> 67．Choosing friends that have fun with or that help you when you need them?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>What is supposed to be the <strong>definition</strong> of true friendship? Without doubt, real friends are those who would stand by our side to render support in time of need and share joy and happiness in time of pleasure. The <strong>criteria</strong> of choosing friends differ among individuals. Nonetheless, there are common features existing in every real friend. As a result, it is best to choose a friend who could not only have fun with us, but also give us support under all circumstances.</p>
<p>Above all, friendship is the most <strong>treasured</strong> gift life renders to an individual. Therefore, everyone should appreciate and <strong>thoroughly</strong> comprehend the essential value of friendship. Alfred Capus used to say, we choose our friends <strong>by instinct,</strong> but we keep them by judgment. With the purpose of making the <strong>priceless</strong> friendship last longer, it is necessary to learn to evaluate the <strong>inner qualities</strong> of a potential friend. Recognizing the value of friendship just constitutes an effective way to select a most deserved friend. As a matter of fact, honesty stands out as the most fundamental element that maintains good friendship. Mutual understanding and trust, as well as the willingness to offer <strong>emotional support</strong> in time of difficulties contribute tremendously to maintaining the <strong>solidity</strong> of friendship. Furthermore, heart-to-heart <strong>compassion</strong> and the enjoyment of <strong>companionship</strong> with each other are also desirable qualities of pure friendship.</p>
<p>Admittedly, pleasure and happiness are intensified while having fun with good friends. Spending joyful hours together with a partner would help us <strong>get rid of</strong> loneliness and <strong>cope with</strong> daily pressure. Without doubt, this could be regarded as the prerequisite factor to choose a friend. Suppose there is no sense of joy that could be obtained while staying with a person, by no means could he become a close friend. After all, it is the comfortable feelings and mental satisfaction that connect the hearts of two people and <strong>make it possible for</strong> them to build an enjoyable friendship.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is every reason to emphasize the truth that a friend in need is a friend indeed. In <strong>adversity</strong> we are able to know if a person really owns the basic qualities of a true friend. On these special occasions, one’s heart could be easily displayed before others’ eyes. If a <strong>so-called</strong> friend could only spend joyful hours with us but <strong>desert</strong> us when harsh time arrives, he could never be accepted as a reliable friend. We could easily imagine the overwhelming despair at the moment when we are ignored by someone who is trusted by us. Needless to say, it is better to stop making friends with him; otherwise he might <strong>repeatedly</strong> hurt our feelings in the future. Only the one who continues to give emotional and practical support to us regardless of all the obstacles and personal sacrifices could be cherished as a best friend.</p>
<p>All in all, everyone should be encouraged to remain rational and keep a clear mind before making friends with others. In order to avoid feeling <strong>regrettable</strong> after choosing a wrong friend, it is necessary to comprehend the most fundamental qualities found in pure and everlasting friendship. Anyhow, those who would offer selfless support in time of need deserve our lifelong cherishment.</p>

<p>67．选择能与你一起玩乐的朋友还是选择能在你需要时给予帮助的朋友？</p>
<p>究竟什么才是真正的友谊呢？毋庸置疑，真正的朋友会在困难之时站在身边给予你支持，并在快乐时与你共享欢愉与幸福。择友标准因人而异。然而，所有真正的朋友都有一些共同点。因此，最好选择既能共享欢乐，又能在任何情况下都给予支持的朋友。</p>
<p>首先，友谊是人生赋予每个人最珍贵的礼物。因此，人们都应该重视并完全理解其基本价值所在。艾尔弗雷德·卡普斯曾经说过，我们通过直觉择友，但需根据判断来维系友谊。为了使珍贵的友谊长存，有必要学会评价潜在朋友的内在品质。懂得友谊的价值就是选择挚友的一个有效方法。其实，真诚应成为维持美好友谊的最基本因素。彼此间相互的理解与信任，以及在艰难时刻给予精神支持的意愿同样对保持牢固的友谊起着巨大的作用。除此之外，率直的同情心和彼此为伴时的快乐感受也是造就纯洁友谊的称心特性。</p>
<p>不能否认，在与好朋友玩乐时，愉悦感与幸福感会增强。与同伴共度愉快时光可以帮助我们摆脱寂寞，调节日常压力。这一点的确可作为择友的前提条件之一。假设与某人共处时感觉不到丝毫的快乐，那么，他／她永远不可能成为密友。不管怎样，是舒适的感受及心灵的满足使得美好友谊的建立成为可能。</p>
<p>然而，我们理应珍视“患难见真情”。在危难中我们能够得知一个人是否真正具备真朋友的基本素质。此时人的心灵最易暴露于他人眼前。倘若一个所谓的朋友只能与我们共同享乐，却在艰难时刻来临之际弃我们于不顾，那么他／她绝对无法成为可靠的朋友。不难想象当我们被自己信任的人忽视时巨大的绝望。不用说，最好与他／她停止交往，否则将来他／她也许会一再伤害我们的感情。只有那些不顾任何障碍和自我牺牲，继续给予我们精神上和实际支持的人才配做最好的朋友。</p>
<p>总之，我们都应在交友前保持理性与清醒的头脑。为了避免因选错朋友而后悔，有必要理解纯真长久友谊的根本特质。不管怎样，那些在我们需要时伸出援助之手的人才值得我们用一生的光阴去珍惜。</p>

<h3><span id="68should-children-play-and-study-rather-than-learn-how-to-do-household-chores"> 68．Should children play and study rather than learn how to do household chores?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>Childhood is commonly recognized as a golden period in one’s life. <strong>Immersed in</strong> the <strong>loving care</strong> from their family, children are enjoying happiness all the time. Every joyful day is to be cherished in memory. These worryfree and innocent little <strong>creatures</strong> are entitled to play and study. However, in order to become more responsible individuals, children should learn how to do household chores at the same time. Participating in chores is both meaningful and beneficial to a child’s self-development.</p>
<p>Without doubt, the major task of children is to play and study. The passion for playing is found in all children. It is more than an enjoyable process to have fun. During the course of playing games, children will obtain the opportunity to develop their wits. Studying is equally important. From the medical angle, it is widely acknowledged that children’s brains are the quickest to <strong>assimilate</strong> new knowledge and thus this stage of life <strong>lays the foundation</strong> for their future education. Such a physical advantage should be utilized in their daily activities. Besides, what has been learned while playing and studying might be deeply rooted in their memory and produce profound influences on their character and individual qualities. That just <strong>clarifies</strong> the simple reason why parents are willing to spend a large amount of money on toys, books, and other expensive tools to <strong>assist</strong> their children to play and study.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the benefits gained through playing and studying are far from enough in this critical period of life. Grasping some practical skills is also of great importance to one’s future. The most fundamental household duties may include washing clothes, cleaning the floor, setting the table, feeding the pet, cooking simple dishes, watering the garden and <strong>so forth.</strong> All these duties are easy to perform but will bring about tremendous benefits to children. To a certain degree, engaging in household chores symbolizes the <strong>focal point</strong> for a child to take the <strong>initial</strong> responsibility. A strong sense of fulfillment could be felt in the meantime. Such a psychological reward will undoubtedly motivate children to commit greater tasks when they grow up. While doing housework, children could gradually understand the fact that happiness is obtained through hard work and <strong>laziness</strong> is a bad habit. Diligence is a desirable quality that makes a person successful. What’s more, mastering these skills also helps children develop good living habits and trains them to become independent. Accordingly, the ability to do housework should be cultivated as early as possible.</p>
<p>Furthermore, at the sweet moment when all the family members are doing household chores together, relationships between parents and children could be remarkably strengthened and the generation gap may be narrowed as well. It is in the process of <strong>making joint efforts</strong> that children are realizing the real value of happiness. They may learn to respect their parents’ hard work in the future and try to become more helpful and <strong>considerate</strong> than before.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is the <strong>indisputable</strong> responsibility of parents to teach their children how to become diligent, skillful and knowledgeable. Therefore, in addition to encouraging them to study hard and allowing them to play well, parents should also ask them to engage in household chores. As a matter of fact, it is destined to be a rewarding practice that will benefit an <strong>immature</strong> child both mentally and realistically.</p>

<p>68．孩子们应该好好学习、开心玩耍，而不必学做家务？</p>
<p>人们通常把童年比作一生中的黄金时期。沉浸于家人亲切的关怀之中的孩子们时时刻刻都享受着幸福。每一天都值得在记忆中珍藏。这些无忧无虑、天真无邪的小生灵理应拥有学习和玩耍的权利。然而，若想变得更有责任感，他们同时也应该学会做家务，因为做家务对孩子的自我成长既有意义也有益处。</p>
<p>的确，玩耍和学习是孩子的“天职”。每个孩子都对玩耍饱含热情。然而玩耍的意义不仅仅是供人开心。在玩耍的过程中，孩子们将获得开发智力的机会。学习也同样重要。从医学角度来说，众所周知，儿童的大脑吸收新知识的速度是最快的，因此，这个阶段会为孩子今后接受教育打下良好的基础。这种生理优势应当在日常活动中加以利用。此外，玩耍和学习中掌握的东西会深深印在脑海中，并对他们的性格和个性品质产生深刻的影响。这恰好解释了为什么家长愿意花很多钱给孩子买书、玩具以及其他辅助学习和玩耍的昂贵用具了。</p>
<p>然而，在这个关键的人生阶段，从玩耍和学习中得到的益处是远远不够的。掌握一些实用技能对未来也很重要。最基本的家务包括洗衣服、清洁地板、摆餐桌、给宠物喂食、做简餐、给花园浇水等。这些任务很容易完成，但会给孩子带来很多的好处。在某种程度上，做家务意味着孩子已开始承担责任了，同时，强烈的成就感油然而生。这种精神上的奖励必定会促使他们长大后担负起更重大的使命。做家务时，孩子们会逐渐懂得幸福源于劳动，而懒惰是个坏习惯。勤奋是成功所需的优秀品质。此外，掌握这些技能还能使他们养成良好的习惯，并且变得独立。因此，孩子们应当尽早学做家务。</p>
<p>另外，在所有家庭成员一起做家务的甜蜜时刻，父母与孩子的关系也会奇迹般地拉近，代沟也随之缩小。正是在共同努力的过程中孩子体会到了幸福的真正价值所在。他们也许在以后会学着尊重父母的辛苦工作，并尽力使自己更乐于助人，更体贴入微。</p>
<p>总之，教孩子如何成为勤奋、有技能且有知识的人，家长责无旁贷。因此，除了鼓励他们努力学习，并允许他们好好玩耍之外，也应让孩子做些家务。无论心理上还是在实际生活中，这必定是造福于未成熟孩子的有益举措。</p>

<h3><span id="69people-would-be-happier-with-fewer-possessions"> 69．People would be happier with fewer possessions?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>When asked about <strong>the sources of happiness</strong>, different people may express different opinions. Understandably, a person’s attitude is closely related to his values and views of the world. As for those who attach great importance to wealth, the more possessions they <strong>take hold of</strong>, the happier they would become. On the contrary, as for those who cherish simple styles of living, they would feel happier with fewer possessions. Frankly speaking, I am in favor of that position.</p>
<p>From a certain angle, more possessions urge their owners to live under tough pressure and torture them with endless worries about losing them. In fact, managing property <strong>involves</strong> much <strong>brainwork</strong> and is inevitably a complicated and tedious process. Suppose a rich man possesses a large company, he is destined to undertake overwhelmingly heavy burdens. <strong>Business administration</strong> is a difficult field of study that requires more than intelligence and basic skills, but also painstaking devotion and a strong will. The same is true with financial transactions. Normally, the bigger the business is, the greater sacrifices have to be made by the leader. He is also faced with potential risks in many aspects, including tense competitions on the market, possible losses of capital and talents. All these justify the notion that more possessions bring about troubles rather than happiness. People living under great pressure might also suffer from health problems. If a person <strong>is deprived of</strong> the right to stay healthy, how could he become happy? Our modern society is filled with <strong>millionaires</strong> who become ill at an early age.</p>
<p>By contrast, people with fewer possessions are carrying lighter mental burdens. As a matter of fact, a person’s health relies on good mental conditions. <strong>Open-mindedness</strong> is the most distinct quality found in those who are leading a simple life. even if a person is not wealthy, as long as he possesses good health, happiness will be inevitable; even if his house is small and <strong>plainly-furnished</strong>, as long as his loved ones stay with him, he could also become the happiest man on earth. Indeed, the sources of happiness usually <strong>originate from</strong> the plainest elements of life, including love and health.</p>
<p>Therefore, with the purpose of obtaining eternal happiness, everyone should value the simplicity and purity of mind. More possessions might easily lead to mental complexity, which <strong>goes against the essences</strong> of happiness. As a result, <strong>greediness</strong> should be strictly eliminated, as it is <strong>the root of all evil</strong> and also makes everyone unhappy. Just as a famous Chinese saying denotes, <strong>permanent happiness consists in contentment</strong>.</p>
<p>Consequently, in spite of the fact that different people have their unique ways to define happiness, the right to be happy is equal to everyone. Among the <strong>multifaceted</strong> elements that may bring happiness to people, personal possessions should be specially emphasized. Based on the reasons discussed previously, it is <strong>self-evident</strong> to conclude that for most ordinary people, fewer possessions could make them happier.</p>

<p>69．所得较少的人会更幸福？</p>
<p>每当被问及幸福的来源为何的时候，不同的人会表达出不同的看法。可以理解，一个人的态度与其价值观、世界观紧密相连。对于那些注重财富的人来说，拥有的越多，他们就越幸福。而对于那些乐于享受简朴生活方式的人而言，所得越少，他们就越幸福。坦率地讲，我赞同后者。</p>
<p>从某个角度来看，过多的财富促使所有者生活在强压之下，并且备受无尽忧虑的折磨，唯恐将失去它们。实际上，管理财产是要动很多脑筋的，因此不可避免地成为一个复杂且辛苦的过程。假设一位富翁拥有一家大型公司，他必定要承受无比沉重的负担。企业管理是一门高难度的学问，需要的不仅仅是智慧与基本技能，还需要艰苦的奉献精神与坚韧的意志。理财也一样。通常情况下，企业规模越大，领导者作出的牺牲也就越多。同时，他／她还面临很多方面的潜在风险，包括市场上激烈的竞争、可能发生的资本亏损与人才流失。所有这些都证明，拥有过多财富带来的是麻烦而非幸福。生活在重压之下的人们还可能遭受健康问题的困扰。倘若一个人被剥夺了享有健康的权利，他／她又怎么能获得幸福呢？现代社会有很多百万富豪很年轻时就患了疾病。</p>
<p>相比而言，拥有较少财富的人承受的负担相对较轻。实际上，人的健康依靠良好的心态。心胸开阔是过简单生活的人最明显的性格特征。即使一个人并不富有，只要他／她拥有健康，幸福感便油然而生。尽管住的房子既小又不豪华，只要与亲爱的家人在一起，他／她也能成为世界上最幸福的人。的确，幸福源于人生中最简单的元素，包括爱和健康。</p>
<p>因此，为了获得长久的幸福，人人都应该珍视心灵的纯朴。更多的拥有容易导致复杂的思想，这与幸福的本质相悖。因此，要抵制贪婪，因为那是所有邪恶的根源，并且也使他人不悦。正如一句中国名言所述，知足者常乐。</p>
<p>因此，虽然不同的人都有其对幸福独特的定义，但每个人都拥有享受幸福的平等权利。在各种可能带给人们幸福的元素中，需要特别强调对个人所得的看法。综上所述，对于大部分普通人来说，较少的所得会使他们更幸福。</p>

<h3><span id="70should-people-buy-things-that-are-made-in-their-own-country"> 70．Should people buy things that are made in their own country?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>With the purpose of protecting national economy, some people suggest that consumers should be encouraged to buy commodities made in their own countries. Even though such an action may <strong>do</strong> some <strong>good</strong> <strong>to</strong> national enterprises temporarily, it will <strong>negatively</strong> affect the overall development of the nation in the long run. Therefore, people should be given the freedom to choose their favorite products no matter where they were made.</p>
<p>First of all, economic chain effects have become more powerful in the modern world. As a matter of fact, the essential interests of the world economy are interrelated and dependent on each other. For instance, <strong>trade</strong> <strong>protectionism</strong>, which <strong>restricts</strong> people’s purchases of foreign products, has aroused many commercial conflicts in recent years. It truly contradicts against the essential values preserved in globalization. What’s worse, the <strong>decline</strong> of sales of exported goods might force a number of <strong>import-and-export corporations</strong> into being on <strong>the verge of</strong> bankruptcy. If such a tendency continues, a larger scale of <strong>financial crisis</strong> might be incurred and post threat to the healthy development of other countries.</p>
<p>Secondly, restrictions on foreign products may lead to <strong>psychological inertia</strong> on the part of national manufacturers due to the less competitive market. Competition is considered as a powerful stimulus for an enterprise to keep improving the quality of their products. Suppose all the native buyers are willing to pay for them regardless of higher prices, these companies might not be motivated to provide better service or make their product <strong>reach the highest standard</strong>. The <strong>co-existence</strong> of products made both at home and abroad is a sign of a prosperous and vigorous market economy. Freer international trade not only adds to a country’s <strong>GDP</strong>, but also stimulates the national industries to <strong>keep up with</strong> the development of the global economy.</p>
<p>Thirdly, people are entitled to have more choices <strong>available</strong> so as to make the most satisfactory purchases. Free trade should be encouraged in order that a more dynamic economic system could be established. As the biggest contributors to the market prosperity, all the consumers should enjoy the freedom to choose the most useful goods with the best quality and at the most reasonable price. If a <strong>homemade</strong> commodity cannot <strong>meet their need</strong>, ample supplies of foreign products would prevent them from purchasing nothing <strong>in disappointment</strong>.</p>
<p>Therefore, the global market is a coherent whole and no country should be <strong>alienated</strong>. With the purpose of curbing trade conflicts and creating a fairer and healthier economic atmosphere, the governments should be fully aware of the <strong>potential defects</strong> hidden in trade protectionism. In a word, excessive restrictions on the purchases of foreign products will do more harm than good to the general interests of a nation.</p>

<p>70．人们应该购买国产商品吗？</p>
<p>为了保护国内经济，有些人提议，应该鼓励消费者购买本国产品。虽然此举会使国内企业暂时受益，但是从长远来看，国家整体经济发展将受到负面影响。因此，无论商品产地在哪儿，消费者应有自由选择自己喜欢的产品。</p>
<p>首先，在现代世界中，经济连锁效应已经变得越来越强烈了。其实，世界各国的基本经济利益都是相互联系、彼此依赖的。比如，限制人们购买外国产品的贸易保护主义近年来引起了很多商业争端。这的确与全球化所秉持的根本观念相矛盾。更糟糕的是，出口产品的销量下滑也许会将一些进出口公司推向破产的边缘。如果这种趋势持续下去的话，可能会引发更大规模的经济危机，从而危及他国经济的健康发展。</p>
<p>其次，对国外产品的限制会导致国内生产商因市场竞争较小而产生惰性心理。竞争是刺激企业保持质量的动因，假设所有的本国买主不论价格高低都愿意购买其产品，那么，这些公司便没有了改善服务以及使产品达到最高标准的动力。国内产品与国外产品的共存是繁荣且充满活力的市场经济的标志。更加自由的国际贸易不仅会使国内生产总值提高，而且还能刺激国内企业跟上全球经济发展的步伐。</p>
<p>再次，为了购买到最称心如意的产品，人们有权利获得更多选择的机会。应该鼓励自由贸易以建立更有活力的经济体系。作为市场繁荣的最大贡献者，消费者理应享受选择质量最好、价格最合理、最有用的商品的自由。如果国产商品无法满足其需求，那么，充足供应的国外产品会避免他们在失望中一无所获。</p>
<p>因此，全球市场是一个有机的整体，没有哪个国家应当被孤立起来。为了制止贸易争端并建立起更加公正、更加健康的经济氛围，政府应当充分意识到贸易保护主义的潜在缺陷。简言之，过度限制购买国外产品会对一个国家的整体利益造成更多危害。</p>

<h3><span id="71is-it-impossible-to-succeed-if-one-cannot-accept-criticism-in-teamwork"> 71．Is it impossible to succeed if one cannot accept criticism in teamwork?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>Good medicine <strong>tastes bitter</strong> but cures diseases and saves life, so does honest advice. Though extremely <strong>unpleasing to the ears</strong>, criticism benefits people extensively. Admittedly, nobody is perfect. Just like a powerful stimulus, honest advice urges people to be conscious of their defects and achieve self-improvement. Especially within a team, those who are unable to accept criticism can never cooperate well with others. Thus, in no way could they succeed.</p>
<p>Above all, if a person refuses to accept criticism in teamwork, he is not in a qualified state of mind which determines the chances to succeed. A million uncertainties and obstacles may <strong>stand in the way</strong> before a person reaches the target. Therefore, the willingness to welcome any challenges should be an essential quality possessed by a potential candidate who strives to conquer difficulties on the way to success. Criticism just represents a typical challenge to <strong>be faced with</strong>. The <strong>inability</strong> to appreciate its real value <strong>turns out to be</strong> a tremendous hazard that may reduce the <strong>probability</strong> of arriving at the final destination. Besides, teamwork requires all members to <strong>unite as one</strong> and be devoted to the team wholeheartedly. If one person fails to perform his assigned tasks, criticism proves to be a best cure to his problem and helps ensure smooth <strong>progression</strong>. It is nothing but a necessary approach to bringing about the most desirable result. There is no excuse for anyone to <strong>turn</strong> it <strong>down</strong>. I once joined in a key project with several colleagues. Due to carelessness, I made some serious mistakes at the beginning. The team leader criticized me before the others and urged me to focus my attention. It was then I realized my own shortcomings and made up my mind to overcome them cautiously. Thanks to his criticism, I was able to do a better job and complete the project more efficiently.</p>
<p>Furthermore, everyone should understand the fact that criticism paves the way to <strong>self-enhancement</strong>. Undeniably, the truth revealed by others is usually cruel and hard to accept, whereas the lies told by others are pleasing to the ears. In most cases, it is the truth that is included within criticism. Just as a Chinese proverb explains, <strong>lookers-on see most of the game</strong>. Those who give criticism are actually helping people <strong>uncover</strong> the truth so that they could be clearer about their defects. Only after knowing the reality could a person develop himself in the correct direction.</p>
<p>Last, no one is willing to work together with someone who is too <strong>stubborn</strong> to accept criticism. Thus, he is most likely to be secluded from the group. Needless to say, successful people can never do without the support and help from others. It is beyond the weak power of an individual to reach the brilliant goal totally alone.</p>
<p>Consequently, there is no need to <strong>shun away from any good-intentioned</strong> criticism. As a matter of fact, criticism helps one learn about past mistakes so as to avoid future ones. It is <strong>privileged</strong> to obtain an objective view upon oneself through others’ honest advice. Thereafter, only by modestly accepting criticism could one make bigger progress and <strong>march closer to</strong> the final success.</p>

<p>71．在团队协作中，如果一个人无法接受批评，就不可能成功？</p>
<p>良药味虽苦却可治病救人，坦率的意见亦然。尽管批评极其不悦耳，但它带给人们的益处是广泛的。诚然，没有人是完美的。如同一种强效刺激剂，坦率的意见促使人们意识到自己的缺点并实现自我完善。尤其在团队之中，那些无法接受批评的人是不能与他人很好地合作的。因此，他们也不可能取得成功。</p>
<p>首先，如果一个人无法在团队内接受批评，他／她就不具备决定成功几率的合格心态。在达到目标之前会遭遇无数迷茫与阻碍。因此，愿意接受任何挑战是一个正在奋力克服成功之路上的困难的拼搏者所拥有的最基本素质。批评就是必须面对的典型挑战之一。倘若不能理解其价值所在，就会面临达到最终目的的成功率下降的风险。此外，团队协作要求所有的成员都团结一致并为团队全心全意奉献。如果某个人无法履行被分配的任务，给予批评就是助其解决问题、确保任务顺利进展的最好方法。这其实就是取得最理想结果的一个必要途径。任何人都没有理由拒绝别人对自己的批评。我曾经与几个同事加入了一个重点项目。刚开始时，由于粗心，我犯了一些严重的错误。组长在众人面前批评了我，并告诫我工作时要集中注意力。直到那时我才意识到了自己的不足，并且下定决心努力克服这些不足。多亏了他的批评，我改善了自己的表现，最终更有效率地完成了任务。</p>
<p>此外，每个人都应该懂得，批评可以促进自我提升。不能否认，他人揭露的现实通常是残酷且难以接受的，而谎言则是悦耳的。在大多数情况下，真理蕴含在批评之中。正如一句中国格言所述，旁观者清。批评者实际上在帮助人们发现事实真相，从而使其更加清楚自己的不足。他们也只有了解了实际情况才能朝正确的方向发展自我。</p>
<p>最后，没人希望同那些不情愿接受批评的固执之人共事。因此，这个人很可能会被团队孤立。不用说，成功者是离不开他人的支持与帮助的。单单依靠个人的微弱力量是无法达到辉煌目标的。</p>
<p>因此，没有必要躲避任何善意的批评。其实，批评有助于人们从过去的错误中汲取教训以避免以后再次犯错。能够听取他人对自己的真诚建议是一种荣幸。因此，只有虚心接受批评才能取得更大进步，继而向最后的成功迈进。</p>

<h3><span id="72should-all-teachers-be-required-to-take-courses-every-five-years-to-update-their-knowledge"> 72．Should all teachers be required to take courses every five years to update their knowledge?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>As is generally recognized, school education contributes tremendously to the promising future of the human society. The overall quality of young students is intimately associated with the teaching level of school teachers. In the face of the <strong>ceaseless</strong> changes in the new age, all responsible educators should take <strong>immediate</strong> precautions against the backwardness of knowledge taught in classrooms. Moreover, continuous evolutions of teaching methods are also demanded. Therefore, it is imperative for all school teachers to <strong>renew</strong> their own knowledge by taking courses <strong>periodically</strong>.</p>
<p>In the first place, the society is developing at a fast speed with fresh changes showing up all the time. Knowledge accumulated in a teacher’s school years is far from <strong>sufficient</strong> to solve new problems. No matter which subject this teacher is responsible for, there might be periodical updates and <strong>revising</strong> of contents in textbooks and teaching materials. The former concepts are likely to become <strong>outdated</strong> and the old ways to solve problems may prove <strong>futile</strong>. Besides, teachers themselves are <strong>powerless</strong> to <strong>renovate</strong> the past teaching plans to the best degree. Professional consultation is the most effective way to overcome such an obstacle. Thus, it is a wise choice for schools to send their teachers to attend different courses. Take politics as an example. The government is implementing new policies from time to time. The contents in the textbooks might be extensively revised every year. Thus, <strong>it is a must</strong> for politics teachers <strong>to</strong> join in related courses to update their former storage of knowledge.</p>
<p>In addition, taking courses helps teachers enhance their teaching ability, thus making them more welcome by the students. Not only could new knowledge and more advanced teaching skills be gained in class, teachers are also endowed with the opportunity to exchange thoughts with their counterparts. Through profound discussions and attentive learning, new teaching plans with the highest standard could be completed afterwards. Normally, a teacher who is capable of teaching in an <strong>innovative</strong> manner <strong>wins the hearts of</strong> students.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the access to the diversified channels of learning in the information age constitutes a big challenge to school education. Hence, it is imperative to <strong>consolidate</strong> the leading role schools play in the <strong>holy cause</strong> of education. Granted <strong>a wide variety of</strong> means to assimilate knowledge and enhance skills, modern citizens might find it unnecessary to attend school. For example, people could keep learning via the Internet. If schools are unable to provide the best teaching quality for <strong>the masses</strong> and fail to build a more advanced teaching <strong>troop</strong>, the dominant position held by the traditional form of education might be replaced by others. Such a possibility truly exists, thus deserving the focused attention of the authorities.</p>
<p>To conclude, one can never stop the pursuit of fresh knowledge no matter which professional field he is engaged in. In a sense, school teachers are in the best position to learn and there should be no border standing between teaching and learning. During the course of taking in-service courses, they are able to make themselves better qualified to teach others.</p>

<p>72．应该要求教师每<strong><strong>5</strong></strong>年进修相应课程以更新其知识储备吗？</p>
<p>人们公认学校教育为人类社会光明未来作出了重要贡献。年轻学生的整体素质与学校教师的教学水平息息相关。在新时代赋予的无休止变化面前，所有有责任感的教育工作者理应及时防止课堂所授知识的落后。此外，教学方法也应持续更新。因此，所有在校教师定期进修相关课程、更新知识储备是势在必行的。</p>
<p>首先，社会正在快速发展，新变化随时会发生。教师上学时掌握的知识在应对新问题时是远远不够的。无论他们负责哪门课，课本内容与教学材料都可能会有阶段性的更新修订。从前的理念也许已经过时，过去解决问题的方法也许已经无效。此外，仅仅依靠教师自己的力量是很难将过去的教学计划革新至最佳水平的。专业授课是清除这个障碍的最有效途径。因此，学校指派教师参加各种培训班是很明智的选择。以政治科目为例。政府经常实施新政策，课本的内容每年都要大幅修改。因此，政治老师必须参加相关课程的学习以更新自己以前的知识储备。</p>
<p>除此之外，参加进修还有助于教师提高教学能力，从而使他们更受学生欢迎。他们不仅可以通过学习收获新知识与更先进的教学技巧，而且还有机会与同行们交流。通过深入的探讨与专注的学习，具有最高水平的新的教学计划随后便可制订完成。通常，有能力以新颖方法教学的老师更受学生爱戴。</p>
<p>最后，信息时代赋予人们多元化的教育渠道，这给学校教育带来了巨大的挑战。因此，巩固其在神圣教育事业中所占的主导地位是势在必行的。由于拥有多种吸收知识与提高技能的途径，现代公民会认为没有上学的必要了。例如，人们可以通过互联网继续学习。如果学校无法为大众提供最好的教学质量，并未能建立起更先进的教师队伍的话，传统教育形式的优势地位也许会被取而代之。这种可能性的确存在，因此值得引起权威部门的重视。</p>
<p>总而言之，无论一个人从事何种职业，都不能停止对新知识的追求。在某种意义上，学校教师是最适合学习的，而且教与学之间应该毫无界线。在进行在职培训的过程中，他们使自己更有资格教育别人了。</p>

<h3><span id="73should-high-school-students-take-a-course-on-basic-economics"> 73．Should high school students take a course on basic economics?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>Before entering <strong>adulthood</strong>, teenagers should be familiar with some practical knowledge that helps them establish a <strong>rational</strong> view on money. Without doubt, in this modern society whose foundation is laid upon the strength of economy, every individual is faced with the problems of <strong>expenditures</strong>. In order to make school-age children more financially capable and responsible, taking a course related to basic economics is supposed to be an <strong>advantageous</strong> approach.</p>
<p>To begin with, high school students are full of curiosities about the money-oriented world. It is during this special period of life that one’s values are easily affected and primarily formed. Thus, in order to adopt a correct attitude toward wealth, they should be required to comprehend the most fundamental theories in economics. Under the <strong>overpowering</strong> influences of the information age, young people severely lack the common sense and the ability to distinguish between right and wrong. Witnessing the varied financial <strong>conducts</strong> of adults, they would <strong>instinctively</strong> wonder about the truth hidden inside. Thereafter, they might receive some misleading information and be negatively influenced. Misunderstandings, <strong>misconceptions</strong> and <strong>misjudgments</strong> should be the greatest hazard to the innocent minds of teenagers. Learning the fundamental knowledge and theories should be a best way to avoid such a hazard.</p>
<p>Furthermore, mastering some basic knowledge about economics helps teenagers make practical and feasible plans for their future academic and career life. Such plans should be <strong>sketched out</strong> as early as possible so as to ensure their smooth and effective implementation afterwards. In fact, economics focuses on the study of what constitutes rational human behavior in the endeavor to <strong>fulfill</strong> needs and wants. Obtaining comprehension about these issues enables young people to <strong>look ahead into the future</strong> more clearly. Thus, a <strong>scientific plan</strong> could be <strong>drawn up</strong> under the guidelines elaborated in the economics class.</p>
<p>Finally, courses on basic economics could also teach students how to spend, use and save money. These are problems they are already faced with in daily life. For instance, they may encounter the problem of having only limited <strong>savings</strong> with which to fulfill their personal needs. As a result, certain choices have to be made to deal with the amount of money available properly. A portion could be spent on books or educational tools. And the rest may be used for entertainment, like going to the cinema or taking a short trip. Some practical knowledge in basic economics just shows the students how to <strong>calculate</strong> money and arrange it in the most effective way.</p>
<p>All in all, economics belongs to the <strong>branch of science</strong> that is closely related to the life of all social members, including those who have not yet arrived at adulthood. The <strong>above-mentioned</strong> reasons are combined together to justify the necessity for high school students to take a preliminary course on this field of studies. In effect, it does not only bring practical benefits to their present, but also to their future.</p>

<p>73．中学生应该学习基础经济学课程吗？</p>
<p>在进入成人期之前，青少年应该熟悉一些实用知识以帮助他们形成理性的金钱观。毫无疑问，在这个建立在经济实力基础之上的现代社会里，每个人都会面对消费的问题。为了使青少年成为更有经济能力与责任感的人，学习基础经济学课程应该是一个颇具优势的方法。</p>
<p>首先，中学生对这个以金钱为导向的世界充满了好奇。也正是在这个特殊时期人的价值观更易遭受影响并最初形成。因此，为了使其持有正确的财富观，应该要求他们理解最基础的经济理论。在信息时代强大的影响之下，年轻人严重缺乏辨别是非的常识与能力。目睹了大人们各种经济行为以后，他们会下意识地思考隐藏其中的奥秘。因此，他们有可能接收到一些误导性信息，并受其负面影响。误解、错误的观念与判断是对青少年幼稚心灵的最大威胁。若想避免这个威胁，学习基础知识和理论是最好的办法。</p>
<p>此外，掌握基础经济学知识帮助青少年制订出实用可行的未来学业和职业计划。此类计划需要尽早做出以确保将来顺利有效的实施。其实，经济学是着重研究在试图满足需求时合理的个人行为的构成要素。获得对这些问题的理解使年轻人能够更清晰地展望未来。于是，在经济学课上所学内容的指导下，他们可以制订出科学的计划。</p>
<p>最后，基础经济学课程还能教学生怎么花钱、用钱与省钱。这些都是他们已经在日常生活中面对的问题。例如，他们可能会遇到用自己仅有的有限存款满足个人需要的问题。因此，为了恰当地处置一定数额的可用资金，他们需要作出某些选择。一部分钱可能用在购买书籍或学习工具上，剩下的可能用于像看电影、进行短途旅行之类的娱乐。基础经济学中的有些实用知识会指导学生以最有效的方式计算、安排自己的钱。</p>
<p>总之，经济学属于与所有社会成员的生活息息相关的科学分支，其中也包括未成年人。上述原因综合起来可证明，中学生学习基础经济学是有必要的。实际上，这不仅有益于他们的现在，也有益于他们的未来。</p>

<h3><span id="74the-best-way-to-teach-children-about-responsibility"> 74．The best way to teach children about responsibility</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>The society has an increasing demand for responsible citizens. Unfortunately, not everyone is capable of <strong>carrying responsibilities</strong>. The <strong>cultivation</strong> of such ability involves a complicated range of elements, including patience, <strong>meticulous</strong> cares and whole-hearted devotions. As a result, it is extremely necessary to teach children to be responsible before they grow up. <strong>Raising pets</strong> could be an effective way to achieve such a <strong>goal</strong>.</p>
<p>First of all, taking good care of others is a primary step to become a responsible individual. Just like a baby who lives under the <strong>endless</strong> care from its mother, an animal also relies <strong>largely</strong> on the <strong>affectionate</strong> care from its owner. If a child has been given the chance to play the role of a little mother, she would have a further comprehension about what love and care really mean. She may <strong>be determined to</strong> render the greatest care to her pet and try to make it healthier and stronger. In fact, such a psychological feedback is helpful to children’s <strong>mental</strong> <strong>growth</strong> and prepares them for greater responsibilities.</p>
<p>Secondly, during the course of pet-raising, children would realize difficulty in <strong>maintaining</strong> the responsibility. They would learn to cherish the hard work of their parents and become more considerate. <strong>Outwardly</strong>, taking care of a small animal appears to be a simple task. Only after <strong>assuming</strong> the duty could a child fully sense the difficulty in doing it well. Each step needs to be followed cautiously. He has to commit <strong>a series of</strong> complicated duties, including learning about <strong>habitual nature</strong> of the pet, preparing for the suitable amount of food to feed it in time, doing cleaning and even playing with it. These may remind them of what parents would do while taking care of their child. It is likely for the little pet owner to thoroughly understand the hardships his parents have <strong>undergone</strong> to <strong>bring</strong> him <strong>up</strong>. Accordingly, he will try to respect and cherish the hard work of their parents more than before. This should be the sign of his progress toward maturity.</p>
<p>Moreover, raising pets allows children to experience the happiness of being devoted to others. No matter how many troubles they have encountered to feed their pets, these efforts shall never be made vainly. The process of care-taking <strong>fills</strong> them <strong>with enormous</strong> happiness. Evidently, the wholehearted devotion granted to animals makes children appreciate the real essences of happiness. They may also realize that being devoted to others could make one’s life both meaningful and joyful.</p>
<p>In brief, taking care of an animal not only presents to children the nature of responsibility, but also lets them experience the difficulty and happiness of carrying responsibilities. Indeed, it is a long way to go before a person becomes a fully responsible individual. Parents should encourage their children to undertake such meaningful tasks at an early age.</p>

<p>74．教会孩子何谓责任的最好方法</p>
<p>社会越来越需要有责任感的公民。不幸的是，并非所有的人都有能力担当责任。培养这种能力涉及一系列复杂的元素，包括耐心、无微不至的关怀以及全心全意的付出。因此，在孩子长大前教导他们有责任感是极其有必要的。养宠物是达到此目的的一个有效方法。</p>
<p>首先，照顾他人是责任感形成的第一步。如同一个需要母亲精心呵护的婴儿般，小宠物也多半依赖主人的悉心照顾。如果给孩子扮演小妈妈的机会的话，他／她会更深入理解关爱的真正含义。为了让小动物更健康茁壮成长，他／她会下定决心给予它最细心的照顾。其实这种心理反应对儿童的心理成长有益，并为其在未来承担更大责任做了充分的准备。</p>
<p>其次，在养宠物的过程中，他们会意识到承担责任是不容易的。他们会学着珍惜父母的劳苦，并且变得更加体贴。表面上看，照顾小动物似乎是很简单的任务。只有在他们履行了这个任务后才完全意识到要做好是很难的。每一个步骤都要用心完成。他／她需要完成一系列繁琐的任务，包括学习宠物的习性，按时按量给其喂食，打扫卫生乃至陪其玩耍。这些会让孩子们想起父母为他们所做的。很可能小主人也许会彻底懂得父母抚养他们长大要付出多少汗水。因此，他们会比以前更加尊敬和珍惜父母的辛劳，从而又向成熟迈进了一步。</p>
<p>此外，养宠物会让孩子们体会到为他人付出的幸福。无论他们在喂养动物的过程中遇到了多少困难，这些努力都不会是徒劳的。在给予照料的过程中他们会收获巨大的幸福。很明显，对小动物的全心付出教会孩子们领会幸福的真正本质。他们也会领悟到为别人付出使人生有意义且充满欢乐。</p>
<p>总之，照顾小动物不仅让孩子们明白责任的本质，而且还使他们体验到承担责任的艰难与幸福。的确，要想成为一个完完全全负责任的人还需要很长时间。父母应当鼓励他们的孩子在小时候承担这样有意义的任务。</p>

<h3><span id="75watching-a-movie-in-a-cinema-or-at-home"> 75．Watching a movie: in a cinema or at home?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>Watching movies could be an effective way to <strong>escape from</strong> daily burdens temporarily and enjoy a moment of leisure and fun. Thus, this means of recreation is popular among the masses. Some <strong>viewers</strong> prefer to see a movie in the cinema. Others insist that it is a better choice to see a movie at home. As far as I am concerned, it could be more advantageous to go to the cinema.</p>
<p>Above all, the cinema is capable of creating the best atmosphere for the audience to enjoy a movie. A familiar <strong>scene</strong> would <strong>come into people’s mind</strong> whenever the cinema is mentioned: comfortably seated before the wide silver screen, the audiences are experiencing the vivid <strong>visual effects</strong> and the <strong>amazing</strong> sound effects produced by the advanced equipment installed in the cinema. Needless to say, <strong>motion pictures</strong> seen at home could never match the exceptionally high quality of those shown in the cinema. Ever since the emergence of the <strong>IMAX</strong> and <strong>3D</strong> <strong>technology</strong>, an increasing number of movie fans have made the cinema their first choice. Concrete evidence could be found in <em>Avatar</em>, a prestigious and <strong>bestselling</strong> 3D film which <strong>is noted for</strong> its marvelous visual and sound effects. Only by entering the IMAX cinema could the real <strong>charms</strong> of this movie be fully appreciated.</p>
<p>In addition, viewers will be given the opportunity to see the newest movies in the cinema. Actually, the most recently-produced ones could only be found in cinemas. It is impossible for people to download or buy the <strong>DVD</strong> <strong>versions</strong>. Passionate fans are mostly willing to pay for the tickets in order to enjoy them at the earliest time. If they are lucky enough, they could also obtain the <strong>admissions</strong> to the <strong>premieres</strong> of certain famous productions. On such occasions, their favorite directors and actors will be present in the cinema. This definitely constitutes a unique <strong>superiority</strong> that cinemas possess.</p>
<p>Last but not least, watching movies at the cinema also helps <strong>curb piracy</strong>. Suppose more and more audiences choose to go to the cinema, the number of people buying the pirated DVDs might be reduced to a large extent. This could definitely contribute to the struggle against the <strong>rampant</strong> piracy in the recreation industry. As a matter of fact, piracy not only <strong>causes heavy losses to</strong> movie producers, but also harms the basic interests of the masses in the long run. Therefore, it is imperative for the entire society to join in the efforts to eliminate such a hazard. Seeing a film in the cinema could be a helpful choice.</p>
<p>As a result, in spite of the diversified means of creation nowadays, few people could <strong>resist</strong> the attractions from the cinema. Movies are destined to provide the greatest enjoyment for the audience. Seeing a movie in a better atmosphere would undoubtedly add to people’s happiness. Therefore, it is natural to reach the conclusion that movie fans should be encouraged to go to the cinema.</p>

<p>75．看电影：去电影院还是在家？</p>
<p>看电影是暂时从日常负担中逃离并享受片刻轻松与快乐的有效方法。因此，这种休闲方式在大众中很流行。有些观众喜欢在电影院看电影。而有些人认为在家看电影是更好的选择。在我看来，去电影院是更有利的。</p>
<p>首先，电影院能够为观众观赏电影创造最好的氛围。每当提到电影院，人们脑海中就会浮现出这样一种熟悉的场景：舒服地坐在宽大的银幕前，观众正在体验栩栩如生的视觉效果和由安装在电影院里的先进设备产生的令人惊叹的声音效果。不用说，在家看电影与那些电影院里展现的电影的极高的质量无法匹敌。自从IMAX和3D技术出现以来，越来越多的电影迷已经把影院作为他们的首选。《阿凡达》就可以证明这一点，这是一部著名的畅销3D电影，它以它令人惊叹的视听效果而闻名。仅通过进入IMAX影院就能完全欣赏到这部电影的真正魅力。</p>
<p>此外，观众在电影院将有机会看到最新的电影。事实上，最新生产的电影仅能在电影院找到。人们想下载或购买DVD版本都是不可能的。为了最早观赏到这些电影，热情的影迷非常愿意掏钱买票。如果他们足够幸运，他们也能够参与某些著名电影的首映式。在这样的场合，他们喜欢的导演和演员将到场。这无疑是电影拥有的独特优势。</p>
<p>最后，在电影院看电影也有助于抵制盗版。假设越来越多的观众选择去影院看电影，买盗版DVD的人数将会最大程度地减少。这肯定有助于抵制娱乐业猖獗的盗版。其实，盗版不仅给电影制片人造成了严重损失，而且从长远来看也损害了大众的基本利益。因此，全社会有必要共同努力减少这种危害。在影院看电影是有所帮助的选择。</p>
<p>因此，尽管如今艺术作品有多种创作方式，但是几乎没有人可以抵抗电影的吸引力。电影注定为观众提供极致的快乐。在较好的氛围中看电影无疑增加了人们的幸福感。因此，顺理成章得出一个结论：应该鼓励电影迷去电影院看电影。</p>

<h3><span id="76does-an-effective-leader-try-to-make-others-feel-that-they-are-part-of-decision-making"> 76．Does an effective leader try to make others feel that they are part of decision-making?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>Inside a group, the leader is often given the priority to make the most important decisions. Everyone is supposed to obey his orders all the time. Actually, the art of leadership involves a series of complicated elements that are <strong>by no means</strong> easy to <strong>manipulate</strong>. An outstanding leader should master some essential leading techniques and understand the basic theories in <strong>psychology</strong>. Indeed, letting others feel that they are playing a part in decisionmaking should be a wise idea adopted by an effective leader.</p>
<p>To begin with, the sense of being valued gives everyone the impetus to strive for a better result. Psychologically speaking, people in the lower position will <strong>unconsciously</strong> feel honored if the leader takes into consideration their advice or ideas before making an important decision. It should become an effective stimulus that motivates them to work more diligently to improve their <strong>individual values</strong> in the future. Meanwhile they might also <strong>feel freer to</strong> contribute their constructive thoughts and suggestions for the leader to refer to. These elements are all helpful to raise the overall level of a team and promote the working efficiency.</p>
<p>Besides, a team with a united soul is more likely to win. A leader who manages to make others feel they are indispensable may win the hearts of all members. Normally, successful teamwork requires wholehearted devotion and the combined efforts. <strong>A formidable</strong> force <strong>rises up</strong> as long as there is the unity of will. In fact, it is far beyond the weak power of the leader himself to reach the desirable target. If the co-workers feel that they are an indispensable part of the team, they would undoubtedly render the strongest support to the leader. Accordingly, his leading power is remarkably strengthened and his position is consolidated as well.</p>
<p><strong>By contrast, authority</strong> hinders the smooth development of a group. Those who are working under the <strong>overbearing</strong> power of the leader might get <strong>rebellious</strong> mentally. They would <strong>have no other choice but to</strong> obey the orders mechanically. Deprived of the right to participate in the decision-making process, they would tend to feel ignored by the indifferent leader. The emotional gap between different <strong>layers</strong> is widened. As a consequence, the leader may gradually lose the general support from others. All members in his team may <strong>work like loose sands</strong>. The accomplishment of common goals would no longer be ensured. It is also possible that wrong decisions are being made by the leader without being <strong>reminded</strong> by the outsiders.</p>
<p>In a word, an effective leader is supposed to be one who <strong>makes</strong> everyone else <strong>count</strong>. The feeling of <strong>unimportance</strong> could only undermine people’s passion to work. As long as all team members know that they are included in the decision-making process, they would undoubtedly become more devoted to their duties. Working efficiency might be improved in the meantime. This perfectly explains how the <strong>art of leadership</strong> functions.</p>

<p>76．一位高效的领导者总是让下属感觉他们也加入到了决策制定的过程之中吗？</p>
<p>在一个团队中，领导者似乎总掌握着做最重要决定的优先权。每个人都应当时刻服从他／她的命令。其实，领导的艺术涉及一系列极难操控的复杂因素。出色的领导者应当掌握一些基本的领导技巧，并了解基本的心理学理论。的确，让其他人感觉他们也在决策制定中发挥了作用是一位高效领导者的明智之举。</p>
<p>首先，一种价值感促使每个人为更好的结果去奋斗。从心理角度而言，如果领导者在作重要决定之前也对下属的建议或想法予以考虑的话，那么他们会自然而然地感到荣幸。这可以成为有效的驱动力，促使其更勤奋地工作以在未来提高个人价值。与此同时，他们也会更自由地将自己建设性的想法和建议提供给领导参考。这些都有助于提升团队的整体水平和工作效率。</p>
<p>此外，有凝聚力的团队更有可能取胜。若一位领导者努力让他人感觉他们的作用是不可或缺的话，那么他／她可能会深得人心。通常情况下，成功的团队协作需要全心的付出和共同的努力。只要团结一心就会造就坚不可摧的队伍。其实，单单依靠领导者个人的微弱力量是很难达到理想目标的。同事们若感到他们是团队中不可缺少的一部分，就必定会给予领导者最大的支持。相应地，领导者的领导力会大大加强，同时地位也会得到巩固。</p>
<p>相反，权威阻碍团队的顺利发展。那些在无法抗拒的领导威严下工作的员工也许会产生抵触情绪。他们别无选择，只能机械地遵从指令。由于被剥夺了参与决策过程的权利，他们会感觉自己被冷漠的领导忽视了。不同阶层之间的情感鸿沟就会加大。因此，领导也许会逐渐丧失他人的支持。所有的团队成员如同散沙般工作。共同目标的实现不再有所保证。甚至还有可能当领导作出错误决策时也无旁人提醒。</p>
<p>总之，一个高效的领导是一个让每个人都发挥作用的人。漠视的态度只会破坏人们的工作热情。只要所有的成员都明白他们也在决策过程中有所作为，就无疑会对工作更加投入。同时，工作效率也会提高。这完美地诠释了领导的艺术是如何生效的。</p>

<h3><span id="77should-parents-reward-their-children-with-money-for-the-high-grades"> 77．Should parents reward their children with money for the high grades?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>To some extent, <strong>scoring high</strong> at school might indicate a promising future. Thus, grades are commonly accepted as a reliable criterion to evaluate the potential in a student. In the unprecedentedly competitive society today, most parents are having high <strong>ambitions</strong> for their children. In order to realize these glamorous expectations, they would <strong>spare no cost</strong>. A number of parents choose to reward their children with money if they manage to achieve high marks. As far as I am concerned, there are more defects than merits <strong>lying in</strong> such a measure.</p>
<p>First of all, attaching too much importance to scores will lead to the neglect of practical skills. There is no denying that high marks constitute an indicator of a student’s grasp of the basic theories and common sense in the textbooks. He may be good at <strong>memorizing</strong> and comprehending the fundamental knowledge, but it does not mean he could successfully put what has been <strong>recited</strong> into practice. Thereby, the outstanding performance in exams can never <strong>represent</strong> the equal excellence in abilities. Parents’ money reward <strong>overemphasizes</strong> the importance of high grades, which might make their children totally focus on theories but unable to <strong>handle</strong> practical problems in real life.</p>
<p>Secondly, children might easily form a <strong>mistaken impression</strong> that money could do everything. During this critical period, one’s personal values are beginning to <strong>take shape</strong>. Any misconception would negatively affect the innocent minds. Holding a rational and correct attitude toward money is of tremendous significance to every social being. If money is labeled as a reward for high grades, children might realize the superior position of money in people’s eyes and become <strong>excessively</strong> money-oriented in the future. Thus, in order to avoid <strong>turning</strong> their children <strong>into</strong> the servant of money, parents should never attach too much importance to money by relating it to school rewards. Such an action is unwise and might do harm to the mental health of children.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, better means of encouragement are available for ambitious parents. The simplest and most effective way to stimulate a young student to study well is giving <strong>heartfelt compliments</strong> whenever they make progress. Love, comfort and confidence are the biggest reward they could gain from the <strong>sincere praise</strong> of their parents. Besides, rewards could be given in the form of an interesting trip, useful books, or even a soccer match ticket. All these are more suitable <strong>substitutes</strong> of money.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is unwise for the parents to inspire their children by rewarding them with money. Such a method might unconsciously send some misleading messages to a <strong>nave</strong> child. Due to the lack of real-life experience and the inability to make correct judgments, children are likely to adopt a <strong>deformed</strong> view upon the functions of money and school grades. To be responsible for the future of their children, parents should be fully aware of these potential <strong>side effects</strong>.</p>

<p>77．家长应该对孩子的高分给予金钱形式的奖励吗？</p>
<p>从某种程度上讲，在学业上获得高分可能预示着光明的前途。于是，分数通常被视作评价学生潜力可信赖的标准。在竞争空前激烈的现代社会里，大多数家长都望子成龙、望女成凤。为了实现这些灿烂的梦想，他们会不惜一切代价。如果孩子努力取得了优异的成绩，有些家长选择给予金钱奖励。在我看来，这种奖励举措弊大于利。</p>
<p>首先，过度注重分数会导致对实际技能的忽视。不能否认，高分表明了一个学生已经掌握了课本中的基本理论和常识。他／她有可能善于记忆与理解基础知识，但这并不意味着他／她能够将所背诵的内容成功应用于实践。因此，在考试中优秀的表现并不代表实际技能同等优秀。家长的金钱奖励过分强调了高分的重要性，这可能会使他们的孩子将精力完全放在理论上，但却无法解决现实生活中的实际问题。</p>
<p>其次，孩子们也许很容易产生错误的印象，认为金钱是万能的。一个人的价值观就是在这个关键阶段开始成形的。任何错误概念都会对孩子天真的心灵产生负面影响。持有正确、理性的金钱观对每个社会人都是至关重要的。如果金钱被用来奖励高分，孩子们会意识到金钱在人们眼中至高无上的地位，从而将来也会变得过于以金钱为导向。因此，为了避免使孩子成为金钱的奴隶，家长不应该过度地将金钱与学业奖励联系起来。这会对孩子的心理健康造成伤害，是不明智的做法。</p>
<p>其实，这些望子成龙的家长可选择更好的鼓励孩子的方法。促使学生用功读书最简单、最有效的方法就是每当他们取得进步时给予最诚恳的表扬。爱、抚慰与信心是他们从父母的真诚表扬中得到的最大奖励。其他形式的奖励，如一次有趣的旅行、有用的书籍，甚至是一场足球赛门票都是比金钱更合适的替代品。</p>
<p>因此，家长用金钱奖励来激励孩子是不明智的。这个方法会在无意中给天真的孩子传达一些错误信息。由于缺乏实际生活经验且没有作出正确判断的能力，孩子们也许会对金钱的功能与学习成绩产生畸形观点。为了对孩子的未来负责，家长应该充分意识到这些潜在的负面影响。</p>

<h3><span id="78will-people-feel-happier-when-they-finish-a-challenging-or-difficult-work"> 78．Will people feel happier when they finish a challenging or difficult work?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>Throughout a person’s lifetime, he has to <strong>undertake</strong> a large variety of tasks. It is from the <strong>completion</strong> of different work that makes him a responsible, useful and capable social being. Needless to say, everyone is entitled to feel happy whenever a piece of work is successfully finished. However, comparatively speaking, more happiness could be obtained if one manages to perform a challenging duty rather than an easy one.</p>
<p>In the first place, <strong>self-approval</strong> and other’s <strong>recognition</strong> could be the major sources of a person’s happiness. To illustrate, when he manages to complete a formidable job, a strong sense of fulfillment will rise up and make him <strong>exceptionally</strong> honored and happy. On the other hand, if his unremitting efforts to combat challenges have been witnessed by others, they would undoubtedly <strong>look up to</strong> him with awe and respect. Through the eyes of the <strong>beholders</strong>, he further testifies his own glories. The praise and acknowledgement from others would definitely fill him with pride and joy. Indeed, the competence to make others <strong>convinced about</strong> one’s individual qualities and values does not merely help him win honors from the public, but also brings about far-reaching happiness into his life.</p>
<p>Secondly, the process of conquering obstacles renders more joy to people than the <strong>final result</strong> does. To some extent, encounters of difficulties are actually valuable opportunities for people to make full use of their intelligence and abilities. It is the experience of <strong>going through</strong> all the complicated steps that proves to be both beneficial and meaningful. Thus, any sacrifice during the course of such an endeavor toward success would never be made <strong>without avail.</strong> On the contrary, these painstaking efforts are absolutely worthwhile and deserve to be cherished in memory. They are to bring about endless happiness to people.</p>
<p><strong>Moreover</strong>, it is impossible to assimilate new things from an easy task. By contrast, while solving challenging problems, fresh knowledge could be learned and creative thoughts could be gained at the same time. It certainly adds to a person’s pleasure. Needless to say, the major cause of any difficulty lies in the fact that people have not yet mastered the relevant knowledge. <strong>In other words</strong>, what is encompassed within an obstacle should be new and fresh to the <strong>task-taker</strong>. Therefore, the process of solving the difficulty constitutes a perfect way to get familiar with some new knowledge and gradually comprehend its spirit. Under such circumstances, mastering fresh skills and obtaining new things are indispensable contributors to a person’s character.</p>
<p><strong>In short</strong>, although it takes pains to commit challenging tasks, more valuable things could be gained during one’s struggle toward the target. Being able to go through the obstructions in the way and finally reach the destination fully demonstrates a person’s overall ability and superior mental qualities. These are all the reliable sources of happiness. Consequently, there is every reason to conclude that people will feel happier if they have completed a difficult job.</p>

<p>78．人们在完成有挑战性或艰难工作时幸福感更强烈吗？</p>
<p>人在一生中要承担各种各样的任务，完成不同工作的过程使一个人成为有责任感、有用且有能力的社会公民。不言而喻，在成功完成一项任务时每个人都有权感到幸福愉悦。然而，相比较而言，如果一个人努力完成了颇具挑战性的而非简单的工作的话，他／她会收获更多的幸福感。</p>
<p>首先，自我肯定与他人的认可是个人幸福的主要来源。具体来讲，当一个人努力完成了一项十分艰巨的工作时，一种强烈的成就感会油然而生，这会使他感到无比荣幸与快乐。另一方面，如果他在迎接挑战的过程中作出的不懈努力被他人目睹，他们无疑会对他刮目相看。通过旁观者的目光，他进一步证实了自己的荣耀。他人的赞扬与认可必定会使他充满自豪感与喜悦。的确，让他人对自己的个人品质与价值信服的能力不仅能帮他得到来自公众的赞誉，而且还能为他的人生注入永久的幸福。</p>
<p>第二，比起最终结果，克服困难的过程给予人们更多的快乐。在某种程度上，遭遇困难其实是人们充分利用自己的智慧与能力的良机。经历所有复杂步骤的过程是既有益也有意义的。因此，在这个为成功拼搏的过程中所作的任何牺牲都不会是徒劳的。相反，这些艰苦的努力绝对是值得付出的，并值得被珍藏于记忆之中。它们会给人们带来无穷无尽的幸福。</p>
<p>此外，从简单的任务中是无法吸收新鲜事物的。相比之下，在解决棘手问题时，可以学到崭新的知识，并同时收获创造性的想法。这必定使人更加快乐。毋庸置疑，造成任何困难的主要原因在于人们还未掌握相关的知识。也就是说，包含在困难中的要素对于任务承担者来说是全新的。因此，解决困难的过程也是熟悉新知识并逐渐理解其精髓的完美途径。在这种情况下，掌握新技能与收获新知识对一个人的性格塑造是不可或缺的。</p>
<p>简言之，尽管履行挑战性的任务是艰苦的，但在为目标奋斗的过程中会有更宝贵的收获。能够穿越途中的阻碍并最终到达终点充分证明了一个人的整体能力与优秀的心理素质。这些都是可靠的幸福来源。因此，我们有充分理由相信完成艰难的工作会使人更加幸福。</p>

<h3><span id="79should-parents-help-to-determine-the-future-of-their-children"> 79．Should parents help to determine the future of their children?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>Nowadays, many parents <strong>tend to</strong> exert too much pressure on their children and play the decisive role in determining their future. In spite of the fact that it is the <strong>destined responsibility</strong> on the part of the parents to make important decisions for their children and offer the most reasonable guidelines to help them become mature and successful, children should not be deprived of the freedom to make their own choices.</p>
<p>To begin with, allowing children to make their own choices motivates them to work harder with enhanced <strong>enthusiasm</strong> and efficiency. In the meantime, their abilities could be strengthened and they will become more independent than before. To illustrate from the psychological angle, if a child is <strong>chiefly</strong> responsible for an important decision, he may become more <strong>conscious</strong> about the effectiveness of his own choice. If it finally proves to be <strong>dissatisfying</strong>, no one else is to blame but himself. Therefore, in order to avoid such an <strong>embarrassment</strong> and fully testify the <strong>correctness</strong> of his choice, he has to <strong>strive for</strong> a better outcome by working more diligently and attentively. Cherishing the expectation for others’ acknowledgement, he is likely to make himself more competent and qualified at last. After all, where there is a will, there is a way. Such an impetus <strong>is bound to</strong> be powerful and effective.</p>
<p>In fact, whenever a critical decision has to be made, parents should know their children thoroughly and respect their interests instead of <strong>holding fast to</strong> their absolute authority. Anyhow, it is the children rather than the parents who should play the leading role. If the parents’ choice <strong>goes against</strong> the preference of their children, under no circumstances could it be adopted. Thereafter, the parents are required to communicate extensively with their children and obtain a deeper understanding of their interests, merits and shortcomings, ambitions and other details. All these are closely related to the children’s future development. Meanwhile, they <strong>are</strong> also <strong>advised to</strong> ask their children to express their opinions about the future and cherish their values.</p>
<p>Admittedly, it is most desirable for the children to make choices under the reasonable support from their parents. Due to their rich life experience and mature thoughts, adults are able to make more objective and correct judgment than the innocent children. As the enlightening teacher of their children, parents have the obligation to prevent them from making <strong>immoral</strong> choices. Thus, they should help supervise the conducts of their children and offer constructive and useful guidelines for them from time to time. Children are in need of their help both spiritually and practically.</p>
<p>Therefore, all wise parents should <strong>take charge of</strong> offering the most sincere and helpful suggestions for their children whenever important decisions are being made. In the meantime, children should also be allowed to determine their own future based on their personal preferences and abilities. Only through the <strong>combined efforts</strong> of parents and children could the best result be achieved.</p>

<p>79．父母应当帮助决定孩子的未来吗？</p>
<p>如今，很多父母常常会给孩子施加太多压力，并且掌握着其未来的决定权。尽管为子女作重要的决定并给予助其成熟与成功的合理指导是身为父母固有的责任，然而，孩子们作出自己选择的自由是不应遭到剥夺的。</p>
<p>首先，若家长允许孩子作自己的选择，这会促使他们热情高涨，效率倍增，学习更积极。与此同时，他们的能力也会得到加强，并且会变得比以前更独立。从心理的角度来说，如果一个孩子为某个重要的决定负主要责任，他会更加在意自己选择的结果。假如他的选择最后不尽如人意的话，那么就只能怪他自己了。因此，为了避免这种尴尬，并且充分证实自己的选择是正确的，他就必须通过更勤奋、专注的学习，争取更好的结果。由于期待得到他人的认可，他／她也许会提高自己的能力，并最终达到目的。无论如何，有志者事竟成。这样的动力必定是强大且有效的。</p>
<p>事实上，每当面临重要抉择的时候，家长应当彻底了解他们的孩子，并且尊重他们的兴趣，而并非总是高高在上掌控绝对权威。不管怎样，主角是孩子而不是家长。如果父母的选择有悖于孩子的偏好，那么无论如何都不应被采纳。因此，父母必须与孩子进行广泛的交流，以便更深入地了解他们的兴趣、优缺点、理想以及其他详细情况。这些都与他们的未来发展联系紧密。同时，他们也应当让孩子表达出其对未来的想法，并且珍视他们的理念。</p>
<p>不可否认，孩子们最好在父母合理的帮助下作出选择。由于拥有丰富的人生经验和成熟的思想，成年人会比涉世未深的孩子更易作出客观、准确的判断。作为孩子的启蒙老师，父母有义务阻止子女做出不道德的选择。所以他们应当帮助监督其行为，并且时常给予建设性的和有用的指导。孩子们需要从父母那些得到精神上的和实际上的帮助。</p>
<p>因此，每当作重要决定的时候，所有明智的父母都有责任给予孩子最真诚且最有用的建议。同时，也应当允许孩子根据自己的个人兴趣和能力决定自己的未来。只有通过父母和孩子共同的努力才能得到最好的结果。</p>

<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>Today job hunters are granted richer opportunities to select their most suitable careers. Different <strong>candidates</strong> may have their unique orientations. Some people would prefer to take more secure jobs regardless of low salaries, while others are searching for higher-paid jobs that might be easy to lose. From my own standpoint, accepting a more competitive job offer should be a better choice for ambitious and capable individuals, even though it is difficult to keep the position.</p>
<p>Above all, anyone with real abilities deserves a financially rewarding job. Pursuing a high salary might be the primary intention of most ambitious job seekers. Although the level of pay is not the sole determinant of a good job, it demonstrates the acknowledgement of one’s values. Meanwhile a better pay also ensures a higher living standard and a stronger <strong>purchasing power</strong>. These concerns are extremely realistic but of essential significance to impact a person’s career prospects.</p>
<p>Factually, there is no need to worry about losing a job as long as one is competent enough. Today’s world is full of opportunities for all. In the market-based economy, <strong>human resource flows</strong> are actually a positive phenomenon that <strong>signalizes</strong> a vigorous and prosperous economic environment. Losing a job is not as <strong>horrible</strong> as it appears to be. On the contrary, it might bring about a more desirable job offer. The precious working experience accumulated in the last position might also prove useful when the new chance arrives. Accordingly, richer experience could be gained and abilities might be improved as well.</p>
<p>However, many other important factors should also be taken into account before <strong>landing a job</strong>. For instance, it is a must to select one that could best suit one’s preference and major. Working in a position that one dislikes or has nothing to do with his field of studies will turn out to be <strong>nightmare</strong>. Hence, job orientation should be a <strong>top concern</strong>. What’s more important, the job applicant also has to <strong>investigate</strong> detailed conditions of the company, including the potential of its future development, the <strong>managing styles</strong> of the leaders, the level of working environment, as well as the <strong>promotion opportunities</strong>. These all belong to the series of major factors that need to be thoroughly considered.</p>
<p>Consequently, in the face of numerous job offers, all the potential candidates should keep a clear mind and try hard to avoid any rash decisions. At the same time, it is also necessary to have an objective self-judgment before <strong>applying for</strong> a desirable job. Competitions and chances co-exist on the current job market. As long as one possesses sufficient qualities, he will obtain a most satisfactory job <strong>sooner or later</strong>.</p>

<p>80．选择工资低但稳定的工作还是工资高但容易失去的工作？</p>
<p>如今，求职者拥有了更多机会去选择最适合自己的职业。不同的人也许会有他们独特的定位。有些人偏向更稳定的工作，无论工资高低；而有的人则寻求工资高但容易失去的工作。在我看来，接受更具挑战性的工作对于雄心勃勃而又有实力的人而言才是更好的选择，尽管保住职位并不容易。</p>
<p>首先，有真正实力的人值得拥有报酬高的工作。追求高工资也许是大多数有雄心的求职者的初衷。尽管工资水平并非衡量工作优劣的唯一决定因素，但它能够体现出对一个人价值的认可。与此同时，更高的工资还能确保更高的生活水平以及更强的购买力。这些虽然是极其现实的，但对一个人的职业前景却产生着重要的影响。</p>
<p>其实，只要有足够的实力，就无需担心失去工作。今天的世界对所有人而言都是充满了机遇的。在市场经济条件下，人才流动实际上是一个积极的现象，它反映出经济环境的活跃与繁荣。失业并不像表面上看起来那么可怕。相反，它也许还会带来更理想的工作机会。在从前职位上积累的宝贵工作经验在新机遇到来时就会凸显其价值了。于是，人们可以继续获得更丰富的经验，同时也可以进一步提高自己的能力。</p>
<p>然而，在入职之前还应考虑到很多其他重要因素。例如，选择最适合自己兴趣和专业的工作是很有必要的。在自己厌恶的或与所修专业相距甚远的职位上工作的确是场噩梦。因此，首先应关注工作定位。更重要的是，工作申请人还必须调查公司的具体情况，包括未来的发展潜力、领导者管理风格、工作环境级别以及升职机会。这些都是必须深思熟虑的一系列主要因素。</p>
<p>因此，面对无数的工作机会，所有潜在候选人都应该保持清醒的头脑并尽力避免作出鲁莽的决定。同时，求职之前还有必要进行客观的自我评价。在当今的人才市场上，竞争与机遇并存。只要一个人拥有足够的品质，迟早都会获得最令人满意的工作。</p>

<h3><span id="81are-younger-school-children-age-5-10-required-to-study-art-and-music"> 81．Are younger school children (age 5 -10) required to study art and music?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>In primary schools, pupils are learning a wide range of subjects. Without doubt, the <strong>coverage</strong> of diversified knowledge not only makes the campus life colorful and interesting, but also prepares children for a successful tomorrow. Thus, in addition to the most fundamental subjects like math, language, science and history, other courses should by no means be ignored by the educators. Among them art and music can be specially emphasized. In a word, it is absolutely necessary for children to study all these subjects at school.</p>
<p>First of all, learning art and music is beneficial to children’s mental growth and self-development. In a sense, starting such lessons is an effective way to discover <strong>gifted</strong> children who possess the qualities that make them potential artists. As for the pupils themselves, they are also beginning to evaluate their own talents and interests. Suppose a child used to <strong>be unconscious of</strong> his gift for music, he may <strong>come to realize</strong> it as soon as it is taught at school. Then a future star is to rise. Even for those who might not have a gift, joining in art and music classes is also helpful. For example, painting colorful pictures allows them to use their imaginations and make them more creative.</p>
<p>Besides, campus life could be made more colorful and <strong>pleasant</strong> by the beautiful <strong>drawings</strong> and <strong>melodies</strong> from art and music classes. The <strong>innate</strong> nature of children is the love of playing and having fun. Being confined to the classroom most days of the week and learning a series of serious subjects would easily make them <strong>bored</strong> and <strong>lose</strong> <strong>interest in</strong> studying. Thus, some relaxing and <strong>enjoyable</strong> classes will help them regain their passion for school life. They can use color pencils to paint pretty pictures and engage themselves in <strong>paper-cutting</strong> activities. Meanwhile, singing and dancing to the sweet music also render them great joy and happiness.</p>
<p><strong>Additionally</strong>, entering the primary school <strong>marks the starting point of</strong> a child’s formal education. This period of life is of unique significance to his future. Thus, it is absolutely necessary for educators to select a vast variety of subjects for the students and try to prevent them from <strong>going overboard on one single subject</strong>. As a matter of fact, covering varied subjects familiarizes the students with the preliminary knowledge in many fields and prepares them for further studies. To some extent, it helps children <strong>acquire</strong> knowledge and comprehensive skills to meet the high demand of the modern world.</p>
<p>To conclude, with the purpose of establishing a more efficient <strong>basic education</strong> system, authorities are obliged to draw up scientific teaching strategies for all primary schools. The competitive social reality also urges schools to cultivate more qualified individuals with extensive abilities. After all, the future world belongs to the children. <strong>In</strong> <strong>this regard</strong>, the opportunity to learn art and music will undoubtedly benefit the pupils in the long run.</p>

<p>81．应该要求<strong><strong>5</strong></strong>至<strong><strong>10</strong></strong>岁的已入学儿童学习美术和音乐吗？</p>
<p>小学里的孩子们学习广泛的课程。毋庸置疑，接触各种知识不仅使校园生活丰富多彩且充满乐趣，而且还能为学生的成功未来作准备。因此，除了诸如数学、语言、科学和历史之类的最基础科目外，其他课程也不应被教育工作者忽视。其中，美术和音乐应该引起教育工作者的特别重视。简言之，孩子们在学校学习这些课程是绝对有必要的。</p>
<p>首先，学习美术和音乐对孩子的心理成长和自我发展都是有益的。在某种意义上，开设此类课程有助于发现那些拥有艺术家品质的天才少年。对于学生来说，他们也开始衡量自己的天赋与兴趣。假设一个孩子还未意识到自己的音乐天分，他／她可能会在音乐课上有所发觉。于是，一颗未来之星由此诞生了。即使对于没有艺术天赋的孩子而言，上美术和音乐课也对他们有所帮助。例如，画出五颜六色的图画让他们充分发挥想象，从而变得更有创造力。</p>
<p>此外，由于美术课上绚丽的图画和音乐课中优美的旋律，校园生活也会变得更加多彩、更加快乐。喜爱玩耍和娱乐是孩子们的天性。倘若一周的大部分时间都被限制在教室里学习一系列严肃的科目，他们会很容易感到厌烦并对学习失去兴趣。因此，一些轻松愉快的课程有助于重新激起孩子们对校园生活的热情。他们可以用彩色铅笔画美丽的图画，并参与到剪纸等活动中去。与此同时，跟随甜美的音乐唱歌跳舞也能给他们带来无限的喜悦和幸福。</p>
<p>此外，进入小学标志着一个孩子接受正式教育的起点。这个人生阶段对他／她的未来是极为重要的。因此，教育工作者绝对有必要教授学生多种科目以防止他们偏科。实际上，涉及多学科使学生们熟悉各个领域内最基本的知识，并为他们以后更深入的学习作好准备。在某种程度上，这有助于孩子们获得满足现代世界高要求所需的知识和综合技能。</p>
<p>总而言之，为了建立一个更加有效的基础教育体系，官方有义务为所有小学制定科学的教学纲领。激烈竞争的社会现实也促使学校培养出拥有更广泛技能的合格人才。无论如何，未来的世界是属于孩子们的。鉴于此，从长远来看，学习美术和音乐的机会无疑是对他们有益的。</p>

<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>The unprecedented boom of the word’s <strong>show business</strong> owes much to the highly advanced international trade market today. With an enlarged volume of imports and exports among different countries, it is self-evident that people have an increasing demand of foreign movies and TV programs. Indeed, the ones produced abroad are <strong>no</strong> <strong>less</strong> interesting <strong>than</strong> those made at home.</p>
<p>To begin with, there is no denying that movies and TV programs produced in one’s own country are closer to his daily life and easier to understand. The <strong>setting</strong> of background and plots, and the design of actor’s <strong>lines</strong> all comply with the native <strong>customs</strong>, values and concepts. For instance, in some <strong>comedies</strong>, <strong>the laughing points</strong> are often hidden in the <strong>local dialects or slangs</strong> that could only be comprehended by the natives. It is difficult for the foreigners to grasp the central meaning, <strong>not to mention</strong> the <strong>subtexts</strong>. All these potential factors are combined together to make the movie not as interesting as it is supposed to be <strong>in the eyes of</strong> a foreign audience.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the overwhelming <strong>curiosity</strong> about alien cultures and features considerably arouses people’s interest in foreign movies or TV programs. They might be even more appealing to some viewers than homemade ones. For instance, motion pictures <strong>featuring</strong> Chinese kongfu are a huge attraction to the westerners. Many of these movies made in China have won prestigious film awards like <strong>Oscars</strong> and <strong>the Silver Bear</strong>. This perfectly indicates the fact that home-made productions are highly welcome by overseas audiences. Among the most popular ones, <em>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</em> can be counted. Another <strong>noticeable</strong> example could be traced in <em>Discovery</em>, the prestigious <strong>TV documentary series</strong>. Published in different editions, translated into many languages, shown through varied media channels, this successful TV program truly attracts the world’s attention.</p>
<p>Furthermore, watching overseas movies or TV programs broadens people’s mind and helps them obtain deeper comprehension of social values in other countries. Without having to travel abroad, audiences could gain access to the real-life environment of their foreign counterparts. Through the plots or scenes presented in the media productions, social concepts are vividly displayed <strong>before the eyes of</strong> the public. <strong>Thereupon</strong>, former misunderstanding and prejudices might be eliminated.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, movies or TV programs made both at home and abroad possess their particular attractions to different audiences. It is unnecessary to label either type as more interesting than the other. People are entitled to have their own preferences and select whatever appeals to them. <strong>On all accounts</strong>, the thriving of the modern film and TV industry requires the co-existence of diversified productions.</p>

<p>82．哪些更有趣：国产的电影电视节目还是国外的电影电视节目？</p>
<p>世界娱乐业的空前繁荣在很大程度上归功于如今高度发达的国际贸易市场。随着不同国家之间进出口总量的增加，很显然人们对国外电影电视节目的需求量也越来越大了。的确，国外出品的电影电视节目不亚于国内的制作。</p>
<p>首先，我们不能否认，国产电影电视节目更贴近日常生活，也更容易看懂。其背景与情节的设置以及演员的台词设计都符合国内的习俗、价值观与理念。例如，在一些喜剧片中，笑点往往隐藏在当地方言或俚语里面，这些也只有本地人才能够理解。外国人是很难抓住中心思想的，更不用说潜台词了。所有这些潜在因素使此类电影在外国观众的眼中就显得不那么有趣了。</p>
<p>然而，对异国文化和特色的强烈好奇心会引起人们对国外电影电视节目的兴趣。它们甚至有可能比国产电影电视节目更具吸引力。例如，中国功夫电影使西方人着迷。很多此类电影已经荣获了如奥斯卡和银熊奖之类的著名奖项。这充分表明国内作品也会受到海外观众的极大青睐。在最受欢迎的影片中，《卧虎藏龙》可谓杰出的代表。另一个光辉的典范是著名的电视纪录系列片《探索》。这部成功的电视片以不同的版本发行，被翻译成多国语言并通过各种媒介渠道播出，这样成功的电视节目的确吸引着全世界的关注。</p>
<p>此外，观看海外电影或电视节目拓宽人们的视野，并助其更深入了解其他国家的社会价值观。无需踏出国门，观众就可以生动体会到异域风情。社会观念通过这些作品的情节或场景活生生地展现在观众眼前，于是，以往的误解和偏见可能会随即消失。</p>
<p>坦率地讲，国内外电影电视节目对不同的观众有着不同的吸引点。因此，没有必要将两者中任何一者描述为“更有趣”。人们有权利拥有自己的偏好并选择最吸引自己的类别。无论如何，现代电影电视行业的蓬勃发展离不开作品的多样化共存。</p>

<h3><span id="83what-should-movies-and-televisions-show-the-audience"> 83．What should movies and televisions show the audience?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>It’s vastly accepted that such mass media as movies and televisions <strong>bear</strong> tremendous social <strong>responsibilities</strong>. Totally different from other forms of merchandise goods, movies and TV productions are unique commodities that could produce powerful influences on the public. Thus, every professional <strong>practitioner</strong> in the media world should be required to make their works beneficial to the entire society. What is shown on the screen should encompass contents that help the viewers become fully conscious of the importance to be good and the <strong>fatality</strong> to be evil.</p>
<p>Without doubt, one of the major functions of all movies and TV productions is to remind people to obey social morals. The entire human society is <strong>governed</strong> by law and there should be no exception. Those who go against the law and morals are destined to be punished. This concrete rule should be <strong>observed</strong> by all. As one of the most <strong>profitable</strong> businesses, the movie and TV industries are in the best position to arouse people’s <strong>conscientiousness</strong> instead of being solely obsessed with the pursuit of financial gains.</p>
<p>Furthermore, producers should be responsible of reducing the negative impacts mass media could make on the audience’s mentality and behavior. In the information age, the media’s power can by no means be underestimated. For instance, if too much violence is presented on the screen, many viewers, especially youngsters, may tend to imitate the <strong>evil deeds</strong> of the <strong>leading roles</strong> in real life. This definitely posts a potential threat to <strong>social</strong> security and <strong>stability</strong>. Thus, in order to protect many innocent people from being polluted and misled by the unsuitable contents of movie or TV productions, it is imperative for all movie producers to <strong>filter</strong> what is to be shown in public. In fact, the modern society has an increasing demand for superior quality productions that <strong>embody profound significance</strong> and favorable social values. Joint efforts should be made to eliminate the works that are produced with the sole aim for profits but extremely harmful to the hearts and minds of people.</p>
<p>Admittedly, as long as the <strong>bottom line</strong> of basic social morals is well maintained, movie and TV producers should be allowed the freedom to create meaningful works with varied <strong>themes</strong>, contents and features. After all, modern audiences should be blessed with more choices. Thus, instead of being confined to a single theme, diversity has to be ensured.</p>
<p>Obviously, while encouraging the diversity of features, plots and types of media productions, professionals in this field should be <strong>on the mission to</strong> bring about positive effects to the society. Such a responsibility is of greater significance in the information age. As long as more social members appreciate the fact that the good are to be rewarded and the evil are to be punished, the essential values of mass media could be fully demonstrated and justified.</p>

<p>83．电视或电影应该向观众传达些什么？</p>
<p>众所周知，电影和电视之类的大众传媒承载着重大的社会责任。与其他商品形式完全不同，电视和电影是特殊的商品，它们能对公众产生强有力的影响。因此，每一位媒体从业者都应该努力使自己的作品对整个社会有益。屏幕上所展现的内容应该让观众充分意识到善良的重要性与邪恶的致命性。</p>
<p>毫无疑问，提醒人们遵守社会公德是所有电影和电视作品的主要功能之一。整个人类社会都是法治的，且毫无例外。那些违反法律与道德的人注定会受到惩罚。人人都要遵守这个固定的规则。作为盈利最多的行业之一，电影电视业最适合唤起人们的良知，而并非只执迷于追求经济利益。</p>
<p>此外，制作人有责任减少大众传媒对观众心理和行为产生的负面影响。在信息时代，我们绝不能低估媒体的威力。例如，如果过多的暴力出现在屏幕上，很多观众，尤其是青少年，可能会在现实生活中模仿主人公的罪恶行径。这必定会对社会安全和稳定产生潜在的威胁。因此，为了防止无邪的人们遭受污染，使其免受电影或电视作品中不恰当内容的误导，所有的电影制作人应该对即将公映的作品进行过滤。其实，现代社会越来越需要高品质的节目，这些节目应该能够体现深刻的内涵和优良的社会价值观。而对于那些仅仅为了盈利而制作的、对人们心灵和思想极其有害的作品，我们应尽全力铲除。</p>
<p>不能否认，只要基本社会公德的底线得到良好的维护，电影电视制作人应该可以自由创作主题各异、内容丰富、特色鲜明且意义深刻的作品。毕竟，现代观众理应获得更多的选择。因此，应确保作品的多样性，而不是仅仅局限在单一主题之上。</p>
<p>很显然，在鼓励媒体产品的特色、情节以及种类多样性的同时，业内人士应承担起给社会带来积极影响的使命。在信息时代，这个责任尤为艰巨。只要更多的社会成员充分理解“善恶终有报”这个道理，大众传媒的核心价值就能完全展现出来并得到印证了。</p>

<p>Teachers are often compared to diligent <strong>gardeners</strong> who render endless <strong>sources of life</strong> and the most devoted care to the plants. Without their support and guidance, students could never become useful individuals. Factually, what is gained from the teachers has gone far beyond the limited range of basic knowledge and skills. Their mental influences on the students should not be <strong>undervalued</strong>. In my opinion, teachers are entitled to present their positive political views and social values in class.</p>
<p>Undeniably, teachers should be required to deliver objective knowledge and train the students’ essential skills in class. Their major aim is to make the students thoroughly grasp the essences of textbooks through a series of <strong>stereotype modes</strong>, including instructing, explaining, assigning homework and giving grades. These just constitute the most fundamental tasks on the part of the teaching staff.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, good social values cherished by the teachers may produce <strong>positive influences</strong> on the students, thus offering them guidelines that help them establish correct values. Every qualified teacher will never shun the responsibility of doing so. Indeed, faced with numerous social problems, young students are usually unable to resist the harmful impacts due to the lack of correct mental support and guidance. If their teachers have made their mature and <strong>superior-quality</strong> views known to the students, they are likely to remain <strong>intact</strong> before the overpowering spiritual <strong>invasions</strong> from the outside world. Even today I can still recall the sincere words from my Chinese teacher when she told us about her standpoints on money. In her eyes, one must remain honest and rational before the appeal of personal gains. Under no circumstances should social morals and conscientiousness be betrayed. Such a spiritual treasure has been my clear guidance throughout the years and made me a socially responsible citizen.</p>
<p>However, teachers should avoid showing any <strong>biased views</strong> to the students, especially those associated with extreme political orientation, <strong>religious beliefs</strong> or <strong>rebellious emotions</strong>. Although it is a <strong>human right</strong> to express one’s views freely, spreading prejudiced opinions in public might incur unwanted consequences. Therefore, some political views like the <strong>protesting mood</strong> against a new policy or the <strong>evaluation</strong> of a <strong>resigned</strong> political leader should be kept as private instead of presenting them to a group of students.</p>
<p>To sum up, there is no need to completely prohibit the teachers from presenting their favorable views in class. Students deserve the right to learn more than knowledge in class. In most cases, good mental influences produced by the teachers might be more valuable to their future development. Therefore, teachers should be encouraged to guide their students in an extensive manner.</p>

<p>84．教师不应该在课堂上把自己的政治或社会观念传达给学生吗？</p>
<p>教师通常被比作辛勤的园丁，他们给予花花草草无尽的生命源泉以及无微不至的关怀。没有他们的支持和引导，学生是不可能成为有用之才的。其实，从教师那里得到的已经远远不止有限的基础知识和技能。他们对学生产生的精神影响也不能被低估。我认为，教师有权在课堂展示自己积极向上的政治观和社会价值观。</p>
<p>不能否认，教师在课堂上应该传播客观知识，并训练学生的基本技能。他们的主要目标是使学生们通过一系列固定模式彻底掌握课本的精髓，这些模式包括指导、解释、布置家庭作业以及评分。它们构成了教师最基本的任务。</p>
<p>事实上，教师所推崇的优秀社会价值观可以对学生产生积极的影响，从而指导其也树立起正确的价值观。每一位合格的教师都不会推卸这种责任。的确，在无数社会问题面前，由于缺乏正确的心理支持和引导，年轻的学生通常无法抵抗有害的影响。如果教师能让学生了解到自己成熟且优质的观念，他们就可能在外界压倒性的精神侵袭面前保持安然无恙。直至今天，我仍然记得我的语文老师在告诉我们她对金钱的看法时所说的字字句句。在她眼中，一个人必须在个人私利的诱惑面前保持诚实与理智，在任何情况下都不能违背社会公德和良心。这笔精神财富多年来一直明确指引着我，并且使我成为一个有社会责任感的公民。</p>
<p>然而，教师应该避免向学生展示自己的偏见观念，尤其那些涉及极端政治倾向、宗教信奉或造反情绪的观念。尽管自由发表言论是基本人权，但公开传播偏激思想可能引发不良后果。因此，诸如针对某项新政策的抵触情绪或对某离任领导人的评价之类的政治观点应作为个人隐私，而不应透露给学生。</p>
<p>总之，完全禁止教师展示自己倾向的观念是没有必要的。学生有权从课堂上学到知识以外的东西。在大多数情况下，教师给予的良好心理影响会对他们未来的发展更有价值。因此，应该鼓励教师对学生进行广泛的指导。</p>

<h3><span id="85helping-students-gain-self-confidence-or-teaching-specific-knowledge"> 85．Helping students gain self-confidence or teaching specific knowledge?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>As a most <strong>respectable</strong> profession in the human society, teachers are more than devoted <strong>knowledge</strong> <strong>disseminators</strong>. They are rather <strong>soul architects</strong> who play an indispensable role in helping youngsters construct superior mentality. Qualified teachers are capable of enlightening others’ hearts and minds and lead them toward brilliant success. Undeniably, self-confidence should be included in the qualities teachers strive to help their students to build. However, in my opinion, it is equally important for teachers to make their students educated and capable.</p>
<p>Above all, it is the most fundamental task for every teacher to teach the <strong>specific</strong> knowledge efficiently. <strong>Under</strong> <strong>the instructions of</strong> their teachers in class, students can obtain a thorough understanding of what has been printed in the textbooks. That is perhaps where the essence of school education lies. There is no excuse to underestimate the significance of this preliminary step in teaching. Thus, we may compare the fundamental knowledge that has been comprehended by the students to the concrete basement of a <strong>towering</strong> architecture. Without its stable <strong>sustenance</strong>, the <strong>upper parts</strong> of this giant building might be <strong>on the verge of collapse</strong>. Accordingly, the teachers are required to make full use of their intelligence and adopt constructive teaching methods to ensure the effective performance of this task.</p>
<p>Besides, teachers are in the best position to train their students to become self-confident. A qualified teacher is one who acts as an emotional leader. He possesses the ability to offer the most favorable mental guidance for his students. Needless to say, any successful individual must be confident enough so as to embrace challenges and overcome them with a strong will. Self-confidence is closely associated with self-esteem and <strong>self-assuredness</strong> in one’s individual abilities and qualities. Such a favorable spiritual condition is <strong>irreplaceably</strong> critical during the struggle for success. Students are at an age when concepts and minds could be easily affected by others, especially his teachers. Therefore, whenever a student has <strong>done a good job in</strong> his studies, teachers should offer him compliments and encourage him to go on making good efforts. Likewise, whenever a student encounters a failure or an obstacle during the course of learning, it relies on teachers who continue to support him and help him out of the temporary distress. All these are what an excellent soul guide would do. In most cases, the fulfillment of such duties would <strong>bring out</strong> the full potential of young students.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the teachers’ chief responsibilities have gone far beyond teaching knowledge and cultivating the students’ confidence. They are producing influences in many other aspects. For instance, by presenting mature and <strong>enlightening</strong> outlooks on life and the outside world, teachers lead young people to adopt correct and positive values. Just like <strong>navigators</strong> on the <strong>grand ocean</strong>, they help them pave the way toward brilliant success.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, students are the biggest beneficiaries of school education. Meanwhile, teaching is also a rewarding and meaningful career that fills educators with happiness and pride. Thus, no matter how much sacrifice a teacher has to make, these painstaking efforts shall not <strong>be made for nothing</strong>. With the <strong>emergence</strong> of more confident, knowledgeable and competent individuals, their personal values are perfectly <strong>justified</strong>.</p>

<p>85．帮助学生获得自信还是教授他们基本知识？</p>
<p>作为人类社会最受人尊敬的职业，教师不仅仅是忠诚的知识传播者，他们更像是帮助年轻人构建优秀心理状态的不可替代的灵魂工程师。合格的教师能够启蒙他人的心灵与思想，并引导他们走向光辉的成功。不能否认，自信应该包含在教师努力帮助学生塑造的品质之中。然而，在我看来，教师使学生有文化、有能力也同样重要。</p>
<p>首先，教师最根本的任务就是卓有成效地教授具体知识。在他们的课堂指导之下，学生便获得了对课本中的内容的透彻理解。这也许就是学校教育的根本所在。我们没有理由低估这个教学初级步骤的重要意义。因此，我们可以把学生已经掌握的基础知识比作一座高耸建筑的水泥地基。若离开它的牢固支撑，这座高楼的上层结构就会濒临倒塌。因此，教师应该充分利用自己的智慧并采用有建设性的教学方法确保这项任务的有效完成。</p>
<p>此外，教师最适合训练学生的自信心。合格的教师同时也是一名精神领袖。他有能力为学生提供优良的心理指导。不言而喻，任何成功人士都必须足够自信，并以坚强的意志面对并击败挑战。自信与个人能力品质中的自尊与自我肯定联系紧密。这种优秀的精神状态在向成功拼搏的过程中不可或缺。在学生所处的年龄阶段里，观念与思想很容易受他人尤其是老师的影响。因此，每当学生在学习中表现良好时，教师都应给予表扬并鼓励他／她继续努力。同样地，每当学生在学习过程中遭遇了失败或困难时，教师还需继续支持他／她并帮助他／她从暂时的消沉中解脱出来。所有这些都是优秀的精神向导应该做的。在大多数情况下，履行这些职责将充分挖掘出年轻学生的潜能。</p>
<p>事实上，教师的主要责任已经远远超越了教授知识和培养学生的信心。他们也在其他许多方面对学生产生影响，比如，通过展示自己成熟且有启迪作用的人生观和世界观，教师引导年轻人树立正确积极的价值观。如同茫茫大海中的导航，他们帮助学生驶向辉煌的成功。</p>
<p>毫无疑问，学生是学校教育的最大受益者。与此同时，教学也是使教育工作者幸福、自豪的有回报且有意义的职业。因此，无论教师要作出多大牺牲，这些艰苦的努力不会是无用处的。随着更多有信心、有文化、有能力的人才脱颖而出，教师的个人价值会得到完美的证明。</p>

<h3><span id="86should-teachers-be-paid-at-least-as-much-as-lawyers-doctors-and-business-leaders-are-paid"> 86．Should teachers be paid at least as much as lawyers, doctors, and business leaders are paid?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>The salary level of the teaching staff has been a major concern by the society in recent years. Admittedly, teachers’ pay is lower compared with some other professions. Thus, with the purpose of improving such an unfair situation, some people advocate that teachers should be paid at least the same as lawyers, doctors and business leaders. From my standpoint, I support the idea of raising the <strong>overall</strong> pay level of the teachers. However, the <strong>measuring standard</strong> could be <strong>flexible</strong>.</p>
<p>To begin with, being the devoted contributors to social development, teachers deserve ample pays. <strong>From</strong> <strong>the bottom of people’s hearts</strong>, they are forever cherishing the most sincere <strong>gratitude</strong> toward their <strong>beloved</strong> teachers. Ever since the very first day they entered school, they have begun to enrich their mind by following the enlightening steps of their teachers. Dating back to the <strong>distant Warring States Period</strong> of China, people had already believed in the famous saying that <strong>a tutor for a day is a father for a lifetime</strong>. Indeed, in no way could an individual accomplish success without his teachers. There is enough evidence to indicate that the realization of one’s personal values owes much to those who have sacrificed far more than what they have been rewarded. With the progress of society, the significant role teachers are playing can no longer be underestimated. But for their tremendous contributions, lawyers, doctors and business leaders could have never become wealthy and useful. Therefore, it has <strong>approached</strong> the time to promote their salaries to a higher level.</p>
<p>However, each profession should have its own criteria of salary standard. The paying <strong>volumes</strong> also differ among different fields. It is absolutely unnecessary for all of them to adopt a <strong>uniform</strong> paying measure. Even within the same <strong>occupational domain</strong>, methods of payments might be varied among individuals. To further illustrate, a lawyer could be paid according to his <strong>reputation</strong>. If he has won many <strong>vital cases</strong>, he should earn more than those who are not as famous. Some other lawyers might be paid according to the level of their <strong>qualifications</strong>, including law-related <strong>certificates</strong>, degrees of education or <strong>professional ranks and titles</strong>. For example, a person who graduated from Harvard University should earn more than an average lawyer. The same is true with the medicine field. As for business leaders, they are often <strong>stock holders</strong> who could earn a larger fortune than others. They can also receive their salaries on the basis of the <strong>profits</strong> their projects have made. Needless to say, it is impossible to pay the teachers as much as Bill Gates is paid.</p>
<p>Similarly, a more flexible and scientific salary system should be built to ensure that all teachers could be fairly paid. For example, teachers could be paid according to how well their students perform, either in exams or in varied kinds of competitions. Those whose students gain higher marks or receive more awards could be rewarded with a salary promotion. In addition, if a teacher has successfully completed many major projects and research tasks, he also deserves a higher pay.</p>
<p>Apparently, in order to create a healthier and more harmonious <strong>atmosphere</strong>, <strong>decision-makers</strong> of all professions should <strong>adopt</strong> immediate measures to renovate their paying systems. As for the education field, the demand for better payment to the teachers has been on the rise. Therefore, instead of confining to the outdated and unfair paying standard, school authorities carry the responsibility to improve the current situation.</p>

<p>86．教师的工资至少要和律师、医生和企业家一样高？</p>
<p>近年来，教育工作者的工资水平已成为社会的重点关注。不得不承认，教师工资低于某些其他行业。因此，为了改善这种不公平的局面，有些人提议将教师工资提高到律师、医生和企业家的工资水平。我支持提高教师工资整体水平的想法，然而，在我看来，衡量标准可以是灵活的。</p>
<p>首先，作为社会发展的忠诚贡献者，教师理应获得良好的工资待遇。人们心底始终怀有对自己敬爱的老师最真诚的感激之情。从入学的第一天起，他们就跟随着老师的启发开始充实自己的思想。追溯到遥远的战国时期，中国人就已经推崇“一日为师，终身为父”这句名言。的确，没有老师的帮助，成功便遥不可及。有充足的理由可以证明，个人价值的实现在很大程度上都归功于那些奉献远远大于所得的人们。随着社会的发展，教师的重要作用不应再被低估。如果没有他们的巨大贡献，律师、医生和企业家也不可能成为富有的有用之才。因此，提高教师工资势在必行。</p>
<p>然而，每个行业都应有自己的工资标准。在不同的领域，工资数额也是不同的。所有的行业都采用完全一致的工资标准，这是绝对没有必要的。即使在相同的职业领域，针对个人的工资计算方法也会有所不同。更具体来说，一名律师可以根据其声誉领取工资。如果打赢了很多场重要的官司，那么他／她就应该比那些名气较小的律师获得更高的工资。其他律师也可能根据他们的资格等级拿工资，包括法律相关的资格证书、学历或职称。例如，从哈佛大学毕业的律师应该比普通律师的工资高。医学领域也一样。而对于企业家而言，他们通常是收入高于常人的股东。他们的工资也可以基于企业项目的盈利。不必说，教师是不可能与比尔·盖茨挣得一样多的。</p>
<p>同样地，应该建立起一个更加灵活、更加科学的工资体系以确保所有教师获得公平的收入。例如，教师可以根据他们的学生在考试或各种竞赛中的表现领取工资。如果学生取得更高的分数或赢取更多奖项，那么他们的老师就应该涨工资。此外，如果一名教师成功完成了很多重要项目或研究任务，他／她的工资也应该得到提升。</p>
<p>很显然，为了建立一个更健康、更和谐的氛围，所有行业的决策者都应该立即采取措施革新工资体系。在教育领域，对更高工资待遇的呼声越来越高了。因此，校方有责任改善现状，而不是死守那些过时且不公平的工资标准。</p>

<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>University education constitutes a most crucial stage in a person’s life. Not only does it mark the <strong>starting</strong> <strong>line</strong> of adulthood, but it also prepares students for future challenges in society. More advanced knowledge is being gained and practical skills are being cultivated in the process. In order to make higher learning more effective, some people <strong>propose that</strong> colleges should require the students to take at least one course on foreign cultures. I am in favor of such a <strong>motion</strong>.</p>
<p>Firstly, learning foreign cultures broadens the students’ <strong>global vision</strong>. In effect, the world today is a coherent whole with strengthened connections between different countries. Not a single nation should be <strong>secluded</strong>. As the major force to construct the future world, university students are bearing inescapable responsibilities. An open mind is the best way to assimilate essences of different cultures and intelligently utilize them whenever it is necessary. Moreover, with the <strong>arrival</strong> of the brand new era of information, globalization has made everyone a <strong>villager</strong> in a smaller world. With this regard, <strong>trans-cultural communications</strong> indeed bring about a promising future for the society and its social members. Thereafter, it is highly imperative for university students to take courses on foreign cultures.</p>
<p>Secondly, learning foreign cultures also helps young adults obtain a more objective view about the real situations in their home countries. Su Shi, an ancient Chinese poet, once presented his opinion <strong>stating</strong>, “<strong>I don’t</strong> <strong>know what Mount Lu really looks like, just because I am within the range of it.</strong>” Such a notion is simple in words, yet extremely profound in meaning. It vividly demonstrates the fact that only from a different angle could a person obtain <strong>the real looks of</strong> his own <strong>surroundings</strong>. The same is true with the social reality nowadays. Through the comparison between different customs and cultures, students are <strong>enabled</strong> to know their native cultures better.</p>
<p>Last but not least, former prejudice and misunderstanding could be eliminated by taking such lessons. Without a good command of foreign cultures, students may only have <strong>obscure</strong> conceptions about the outside world. Misleading information from the media also <strong>covers the truth</strong>. Only in the class could the real facts be grasped and comprehended. Thus, the biased attitude held previously can be corrected, which paves the way for more extensive cooperation between countries and also helps preserve world peace.</p>
<p>To conclude, <strong>chaining together</strong> all the merits elaborated above, we are completely convinced that requiring students to study foreign cultures is a beneficial choice. The modern society has set higher standard for those who are to construct the world in the near future. Faced with overwhelming challenges, each individual should be well equipped with a vast range of knowledge and a broadened mind.</p>

<p>87．大学生应该选修至少一门有关其他国家文化的课程？</p>
<p>大学时光是人生中最关键的阶段。它不仅标志着成年期的起点，而且还为学生在未来迎接社会中的挑战作准备。在大学期间，学生可获得更高深的知识，并培养更实用的技能。为了使高等教育更富有成效，有的人提议，学校应该要求学生选修至少一门有关其他国家文化的课程。对此，我表示赞同。</p>
<p>首先，学习外国文化会拓宽学生的全球视野。当今世界其实是一个有机的整体，不同国家之间的联系加强了。任何一个国家都不可能孤立存在。作为建设未来世界的主力军，大学生肩负着不可推卸的责任。开阔的思想是吸收不同文化精髓并在必要时将其巧妙运用的最佳途径。此外，随着崭新的信息时代的来临，全球化使每个人成为居住在这个更小的世界中的村民。鉴于此，跨文化交流的确为社会及其成员带来更加光明的前途。因此，大学生很有必要学习外国文化课程。</p>
<p>其次，学习外国文化也帮助年轻人对自己国家的真实情况持有更客观的态度。中国古代大诗人苏轼曾经在一首诗中表达了自己的观点：“不识庐山真面目，只缘身在此山中。”这个见解虽然言语简明，但意义极其深刻。它生动地表明了一个道理，那就是，只有站在不同的角度，一个人才能看清自己所处环境的真面目。当今的社会现实也一样。通过对不同文化习俗的比较，学生就会更好地了解本土文化。</p>
<p>最后，选修此类课程还可消除以前的偏见与误解。若未精通外国文化，学生也许仅仅对外面的世界持有模糊的概念。来自传媒的误导性信息也可能掩盖了事实。只有在课堂上才能掌握并理解真实的情况。于是，之前头脑中的偏见会得到更正，这就为更广泛的国际合作铺平了道路，同时也有助于维护世界和平。</p>
<p>总之，综合上述所有优点我们完全可以确信，要求学生学习外国文化是有益的选择。现代社会对即将建设未来世界的人们设定了更高的标准。面对如此艰巨的挑战，每个人都应该掌握更广博的知识，并拥有更开阔的思想。</p>

<h3><span id="88do-most-of-the-advertisements-make-products-appear-better-than-they-really-are"> 88．Do most of the advertisements make products appear better than they really are?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>The advertising industry in the modern world has <strong>established itself as</strong> an indispensable power that values the prosperity of <strong>commerce</strong>. Within the competitive business arena today, all ambitious enterprises are earnestly joining in a <strong>marketing campaign</strong>. Indeed, superior-quality advertisements spread via the mass media help promote sales and create shining images before the public. However, regarding the essential nature of this industry, it is fair enough to define that most advertisements make products appear better than they really are.</p>
<p>To begin with, the primary purpose of most advertisements is to persuade the public to buy. Thus, commercial advertisers <strong>seek to</strong> comply with the consumer’s psychological orientation. They are doing their utmost to make the promoted products as appealing as possible. For instance, through the application of <strong>photo editing software</strong> or advanced video technology, designers are able to add shining effects to the pictures of the commodities so as to make them more eye-catching. In most cases, the photographs in <strong>print ads</strong> have undergone <strong>face-liftings</strong> before being presented in the media. The same is true with TV advertising. From a certain angle, each advertisement can be seen as a piece of <strong>fine art</strong> which encompasses more than the objective introductions of products. Colorful imaginations and creativity are indispensable elements often adopted with an aim to attract the consumers’ attention. Meanwhile, by emphasizing the <strong>first-class</strong> quality of the products, they also attempt to leave a better impression on the potential buyers. Needless to say, good quality is a most effective stimulus that could encourage people to make purchases.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the huge investment on advertising and the tense competition on the market might urge the manufacturers to exaggerate the merits of products in advertisements. For fear of suffering <strong>financial losses</strong>, they would <strong>spare no effort to</strong> promote sales. As a consequence, it is <strong>inevitable</strong> for them to adopt <strong>tricky</strong> measures, including deliberately covering the defects of a commodity and focusing totally on its strong points. There also exists the possibility that some businesses cheat the consumers by spreading misleading or fake messages through the Internet.</p>
<p>Thus, it is imperative for the whole society to be fully conscious of the potential side effects of advertisements. In order to protect the common interests of consumers, the government should play an important role. In addition to <strong>formulating</strong> stricter <strong>regulations</strong> for the businesses and advertisers, the mass media also deserves intensified supervision. For instance, Sweden has <strong>issued a ban on</strong> advertisements targeting children below 12 years old.</p>
<p>Thereafter, consumers should remain rational before the tempting <strong>slogans</strong> and glamorous <strong>descriptions</strong> in advertisements. Any rash actions might lead to unwanted losses of money or even regrettable purchases. Bearing in mind <strong>the real nature of</strong> advertising, people will be able to reduce the chances of being negatively influenced. Anyhow, the final choice has to be made by the buyers themselves.</p>
<h4><span id="译文"> 译文</span></h4>
<p>88．大多数广告都美化了商品吗？</p>
<p>广告业已经成为造就现代世界商业繁荣的不可缺少的力量。在当今竞争激烈的商业圈，所有雄心勃勃的企业都热切地加入到市场大战之中。的确，借助大众传媒传播的高品质广告有助于促销，并且可建立光辉的公众形象。然而，鉴于广告业的本质，“大多数广告都美化了商品”是十分公正的判定。</p>
<p>首先，大多数广告的初衷就是说服公众去购买。因此，商业广告商试图迎合消费者的心理取向。他们尽最大努力使促销商品显得颇具吸引力。例如，通过应用图像编辑软件或先进的视频技术，广告设计师能够为商品图片添加视觉效果，从而使其看起来更引人注目。在大多数情况下，平面广告里的图片在展示于媒体之前都经过了美化。电视广告也是如此。从某种角度来看，每则广告都可视为一件艺术品，它包含了超越其客观简介之外的元素。为了吸引消费者的注意力，多彩的想象力与创造力是不可或缺的元素。与此同时，它们通过强调商品的一流质量，试图给潜在购买者留下更好的印象。不必说，好质量是促使人们购买的最有效的刺激因素。</p>
<p>此外，广告所需的巨大投入以及市场的激烈竞争可能促使生产商在广告中夸大产品的优点。由于害怕遭受经济损失，厂商会不惜一切代价促销。于是，他们难免会采用狡猾的伎俩，包括故意掩盖某商品的缺陷，并将焦点完全集中在其优势上。有些企业也可能通过网络散播误导性或虚假信息来欺骗消费者。</p>
<p>因此，全社会都必须充分意识到广告的潜在副作用。为了保护消费者的共同利益，政府应该扮演重要角色。除了针对厂商与广告商制定更严格的规定，还需加强对大众媒介的监督。例如，瑞典已经颁布了针对12岁以下的儿童广告的禁令。</p>
<p>所以，消费者应该在诱人的广告语及迷人的宣传面前保持理智。任何鲁莽的举动都可能导致不必要的经济损失乃至令人遗憾的购买。只要将广告的本质牢记在心，人们遭受不良影响的几率就会降低。无论如何，最终选择权是属于购买者自己的。</p>

<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>The enhanced <strong>flexibility</strong> of working modes is a notable signal to mark the progress of modern society. Indeed, every social member is entitled to determine which style of working best fits him. People serving in different professional fields may also have varied choices. If I am given the opportunity to <strong>decide on</strong> my own working schedule, I would prefer to work 3 days a week with long hours instead of working 5 days a week with short hours.</p>
<p>Firstly, longer working hours within a day might help enhance working efficiency. During every day of a week at the office, people are granted ample time to finish their assigned tasks. Psychologically speaking, their attention could be more easily focused, because they <strong>have no excuse to postpone</strong> what could be done at present until tomorrow. Thus, it is more likely to bring about better results due to the <strong>reduction</strong> on <strong>intermittent</strong> work. In most cases, working <strong>continuity</strong> contributes extensively to better performance. By contrast, if only a limited period of time is spent at work during the daytime, it is impossible to finish a whole task effectively. Much work has to be left until the next day arrives.</p>
<p>Secondly, longer weekend gives people enough leisure time to relax and recover from pressure. Frankly speaking, the traditional two-day holiday each week is far from enough to recover from the overwhelming stress from work. If the number of free days could be <strong>doubled</strong>, fewer white collars will be included in the sub-healthy group. Meanwhile, such an innovative work schedule allows one to make diversified plans to relax. He is able to enjoy these resting days <strong>to the heart’s content</strong>. For example, having a good sleep, doing sports, joining in entertaining activities, watching TV, reading funny books, spending happy hours with the family, cooking a big <strong>feast</strong>, going to the park, or even taking a long journey, all these joyful things could be done within the longer weekend.</p>
<p>Last, if such a new working plan could be <strong>implemented</strong>, people no longer need to <strong>squeeze into</strong> the crowed buses and subways during <strong>rush hours</strong> every weekday. Fewer drivers will be trapped in the long queues of waiting cars on the major urban streets. Thereafter, the traffic jams, which have become a major problem in most cities around the globe, might be reduced. Safety of public transportation could be considerably enhanced at the same time. These are all positive phenomenon that mark <strong>a significant step toward</strong> social progress.</p>
<p>Undeniably, the flexibility of working schedule can do more good than harm to people’s daily life. As long as efficiency is ensured, people should be given more freedom to choose their favorite working and living styles. Judging from all the reasons listed above, I would tend to <strong>reiterate</strong> my standpoint that working long hours within 3 days a week is a better choice.</p>

<p>89．每周工作<strong><strong>3</strong></strong>天、每天工作时间较长，还是每周工作<strong><strong>5</strong></strong>天、每天工作时间较短？</p>
<p>更加灵活的工作模式是现代社会进步的显著标志之一。的确，每个社会成员都有权决定最适合自己的工作方式。不同行业的人也许会有不同的选择。如果让我决定自己的工作日程的话，我更偏向于每天工作时间较长，每周工作3天；而不是每天工作时间较短，每周工作5天。</p>
<p>首先，一天内更长的工作时间也许有助于提高工作效率。在每个工作日内，人们会拥有充足的时间去完成分配给他们的任务。从心理角度而言，他们的精力更容易集中，因为没有理由将现在的工作推迟到第二天去做。于是，由于工作中断的次数减少，更可能获得更好的结果。在大多数情况下，持续工作极其有利于改善工作表现。相比之下，如果白天工作时间有限，就无法有效地完成整个工作任务了，很多工作都得推迟到下一个工作日。</p>
<p>第二，更长的周末给予人们足够的休闲时间去放松自我并从压力中恢复过来。坦率地讲，若想从巨大的工作压力中恢复过来，每周传统的双休日是远远不够的。如果每周休假天数加倍，那么被纳入“亚健康”人群的白领人数就会减少。与此同时，这种创新的工作日程允许员工制订出丰富多彩的放松计划，并且能够尽情享受闲暇时光。例如，睡一个好觉、进行体育运动、参加娱乐活动、看电视、阅读有趣的图书、与家人共度美好时光、烹饪一顿美餐、逛公园，甚至进行一次长途旅行，这些愉快的事都可以在更长的周末内做到。</p>
<p>最后，如果这个新的工作计划得以实施，人们就不再需要在每个工作日高峰时段都挤进拥挤的公共汽车或地铁里上下班了。在主要城市街道上，被困入车辆长队等待的司机人数也会减少。这样，交通堵塞就会得到缓解，而交通堵塞已经成为全球大多数城市面临的主要问题之一。与此同时，公共交通安全系数也会极大提高。这些都是标志着社会进步的积极现象。</p>
<p>不能否认，工作日程安排的灵活性对于人们的日常生活来说是利大于弊的。只要工作效率得以保证，人们应该拥有更多自由去选择自己喜欢的工作和生活方式。综上所述，我认为每天工作时间较长，每周工作3天是更好的选择。</p>

<h3><span id="90can-people-take-care-of-their-family-members-better-when-they-live-in-big-cities-than-in-the-countryside"> 90．Can people take care of their family members better when they live in big cities than in the countryside?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>Controversial discussions comparing big cities with the countryside have continued for years. <strong>So far</strong> there has been no <strong>definite</strong> conclusion from either side. Lately, <strong>a new round of</strong> debate started, concerned with whether living in a big city makes it easier for people to take care of their family members or not. In my opinion, however, both advantages and disadvantages exist within both environments.</p>
<p>In large cities, there are more <strong>convenient facilities</strong> offered than in the countryside. There is an ample supply of daily necessities in <strong>urban districts</strong>. The advanced network of public transport makes it easier for people to <strong>commute to</strong> different locations, including shopping malls, parks and restaurants, etc. Medical care is also more <strong>accessible</strong>, with hospitals being set up on all corners of the city. Thus, health problems could be <strong>addressed</strong> in a timely manner. Meanwhile, there are many places for recreation in big cities so that the whole family can spend enjoyable times together.</p>
<p>However, some undesirable aspects of city life should be considered. For example, pollution has become a severe problem. Waste gas is being emitted into the air from various sources, including vehicles and <strong>industrial</strong> <strong>plants</strong>. Furthermore, the environment is also being negatively affected by high levels of noise pollution. Pollutants are everywhere to be found in urban areas, thus posing a big threat to the family’s health. Another problem lies in the faster pace of city life. Today more and more young people in big cities are deprived of time spent with their families. Therefore, it is extremely difficult for them to take good care of their loved ones.</p>
<p>In contrast, the natural environment in the countryside offers positive benefits to people’s health. In rural areas, people can breathe fresh air, smell the flowers and enjoy beautiful scenery. Green trees, vast fields and <strong>majestic</strong> mountains are all pleasing to the eye. It is the relaxed lifestyle of the countryside that can totally refresh a person’s mind. This helps all members of the family to be <strong>in a good mood</strong> and stay healthy. Being closer to nature is a big advantage of country life. The cost of living is also comparatively lower in the countryside; thus the family diet can be improved. However, there is no denying that the undeveloped infrastructure can cause inconveniences in country life.</p>
<p>In conclusion, taking good care of the family is the most <strong>sacred</strong> responsibility of all social members. Selecting a favorable living environment for them is also an important duty to perform. In order to make a <strong>satisfactory</strong> decision, it is advisable for people to take into account both the merits and disadvantages of the big cities <strong>versus</strong> the countryside when considering about their own personal situations.</p>

<p>90．与在农村居住相比，人们在大城市居住可以更好地照顾自己的家人吗？</p>
<p>大城市与农村之间的比较近年来持续引起颇具争议的讨论，至今仍没有确切的结论。最近，一轮新的争论开始了，话题有关人们在大城市生活是否更容易照顾自己的家人。在我看来，大城市与农村这两种居住环境各有利弊。</p>
<p>大城市比乡村拥有更便利的设施。在城市地区，日常生活必需品供应充足。先进的公共交通网络使人们更容易抵达不同的地方，包括大型购物中心、公园和餐厅等。医疗保健同样也更加方便，医院遍及城市的各个角落。于是，健康问题可以得到及时的应对。与此同时，在大城市中还有很多娱乐场所，因此，全家人可以在那里一起共享天伦。</p>
<p>然而，城市生活也有某些不尽如人意的地方需要考虑。例如，污染已经成为一个严重的问题。废气正从各种源头，包括车辆和工厂，释放到空气中。此外，环境还被高级别的噪音污染所危害。在城市市区，污染物随处可见，从而对家人的健康造成很大威胁。另一个问题在于都市生活的更快节奏。如今，大城市里越来越多的年轻人已经被剥夺了与家人共处的时间。于是，照顾亲人对于他们而言就变得极其艰难了。</p>
<p>相比之下，农村的自然环境对人们的健康十分有益。在那里，人们可以呼吸到新鲜的空气，闻到芬芳的花朵，并欣赏美妙的风景。郁郁葱葱的树木、宽广无垠的田野以及巍峨壮丽的群山都无比赏心悦目。正是农村这种轻松的生活方式能使人完全恢复到最佳心态。它有助于所有家庭成员保持良好的情绪与健康。更接近大自然是乡村生活的一大优势。那里的生活开销也相对较低，这样可以改善家人的饮食。尽管如此，我们也不能否认农村落后的基础设施会给生活带来不便。</p>
<p>总之，照顾好家人是所有社会成员最神圣的责任。为他们选择理想的生活环境也是很重要的任务。为了作出令人满意的决定，在顾及自己个人情况的同时，人们还应该考虑到大城市和农村之间的优、劣势对比。</p>

<h3><span id="91is-it-better-for-children-to-choose-jobs-similar-to-their-parents"> 91．Is it better for children to choose jobs similar to their parents’?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>Since childhood, parents have a direct and powerful influence on their children. Inevitably, people will be more familiar with the professions their parents are engaged in. Thus, they are likely to enjoy the benefits of some <strong>preliminary</strong> career training at home. The jobs of their parents might also be more <strong>respectable</strong> in the eyes of the children. From my standpoint, it could be a wise decision for young people to choose jobs similar to their parents. However, other factors of a career should not to be ignored.</p>
<p>Firstly, parents are able to set good examples for their children so as to help them do a better job. As the first <strong>vocational tutor</strong> in a person’s life, parents can offer the best instructions and the most sincere suggestions without any reserve. Numerous skills and techniques are being <strong>passed down</strong> from generation to generation. In many people’s eyes, it is fortunate to be successful using the same skills as one’s parents. Also, the outstanding qualities of the parents’ can also be passed down to their children in this way. Our society is full of stories that could prove this fact. The following example perfectly demonstrates the nature of <strong>kinship</strong>. Yao Ming, the <strong>prestigious</strong> “little giant”, began playing basketball under the guidance of his parents who used to be basketball players themselves. This world-renowned superstar truly benefited greatly from his parents, without whom he might never have been as successful as he is now. It is also likely that he may pass his basketball skills to his daughter in the near future.</p>
<p>Secondly, relationships between parents and children may have a marked improvement if they work in the same field. In most cases, mutual understanding is strengthened through more <strong>in-depth communications</strong>. They will have more topics to discuss and more <strong>common ground</strong> from which to share. Acting as a magical bridge, similar professions unconsciously tie the hearts of parents and their children together. As a result, the <strong>generation</strong> <strong>gap</strong> that used to hinder effective mental connection will be lessened to a large degree and can be <strong>a noticeable step</strong> <strong>forward</strong>. Everlasting harmony within a family is the earnestly-cherished dream of all social members.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, everyone has the right to choose a job based on his own interests and personal preferences. These factors should not be omitted when deciding on a career. Interest in the profession can make for a joyful working environment. Parents should never <strong>exert</strong> overly high expectation onto their children and force them to take the same job as them. If the child shows no interest in it or lacks enough <strong>competence</strong> to do it well, then they are perfectly entitled to select another profession that appeals more to their heart and their personal preferences.</p>
<p>In conclusion, choosing a suitable job is the most crucial decision to make. For some people, <strong>following the</strong> professional <strong>route of</strong> their parents could be a reasonable choice. In spite of this, thorough consideration has to be taken and any rash actions should be cautiously avoided. Doubtless, remaining balanced in one’s thinking is the key to a successful career choice.</p>

<p>91．孩子选择与父母相同的工作更好吗？</p>
<p>从童年起，父母就对孩子产生着直接且强大的影响。人们难免会更熟悉其父母所从事的职业。因此，他们更有可能在家中就享受到一些初级职业培训带来的好处。父母的工作在孩子们的眼中也显得更值得尊敬。在我看来，年轻人选择从事与父母相同的工作是一个明智的决定。然而，其他职业因素也不容忽视。</p>
<p>首先，父母能为他们的孩子树立良好的榜样，从而帮助他们在工作中表现更出色。作为人生中首位职业导师，父母可以毫无保留地提供最佳指导与最诚恳的建议。无数技能与技术会得到世代传承。在很多人眼中，能成功应用父母传授的本领是幸运的。此外，父母的优秀品质也以相同方式得以继承。社会中有很多故事可以证实这一点。以下的例子就完美地诠释了亲情的本质。著名的“小巨人”姚明从小就开始在曾经是篮球队员的父母的指导下打篮球。这位名震全球的超级巨星的确从他的父母那里受益良多，若没有父母的指导，他可能不会像现在这么成功。在不久的将来，他还有可能将自己的篮球技术传给自己的女儿。</p>
<p>其次，如果在相同的领域工作，父母与孩子之间的关系也许会得到改善。在大多数情况下，更深入的交流可以加强相互理解。他们会有更多的话题讨论，也会分享更多的共同点。犹如一座神奇的桥梁，相同的职业不知不觉地将父母与孩子的心连在一起。于是，曾经阻碍有效的心灵相互沟通的代沟在很大程度上被缩小了，彼此之间的距离迈进了一大步。家庭中的持久和谐是所有社会成员的热切期盼。</p>
<p>然而，每个人都有权根据自己的兴趣与个人偏好择业。这些因素在选择职业时不容忽视。对职业的兴趣可以营造愉快的工作环境。父母不应将自己过高的期望强加于孩子，也不应强迫他们选择与自己职业相同的工作。如果孩子对此毫无兴趣或毫无胜任能力的话，他们完全有理由选择其他更迎合自己的内心和个人爱好的职业。</p>
<p>总之，择业是最重要的决定。对于某些人来说，跟随其父母的职业路线可能是明智之选。尽管如此，还需进行彻底的斟酌，并尽力避免任何鲁莽的行为。毫无疑问，保持思想平衡是做出成功职业选择的关键所在。</p>

<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>An overwhelming sense of happiness can be gained through realizing one’s individual values. Bringing happiness to others results in the person being acknowledged as valuable. Indeed, in the world of humans <strong>expansive</strong> networks <strong>make for</strong> many people-to-people connections. No person is supposed to lead a completely <strong>isolated</strong> life. Therefore, there is no denying that one essential condition in achieving personal happiness is to make others happy.</p>
<p>First and foremost, happiness can be gained through the realization of <strong>individual values</strong>. From a psychological angle, a strong sense of fulfillment <strong>arises during the process of</strong> helping others. Needless to say, no one wishes to be labeled as useless by the people around him and if a person manages to make others happy, he justifies his value. Indeed, being acknowledged as a useful member of the community fully <strong>demonstrates</strong> one’s personal value. Concrete evidence can be seen in Global Volunteers, a <strong>non-profit organization</strong> that aims at providing free education and medical assistance to those <strong>in need</strong>. During an interview, a volunteer expressed his tremendous pride and happiness in <strong>undertaking</strong> such a meaningful task.</p>
<p>In addition, real happiness is to be shared rather than to be kept to oneself. It is hard to imagine how one could feel happy when others <strong>are trapped in</strong> deep sorrow and despair. Under such conditions, the only way out is to try one’s best to <strong>uplift their spirits</strong>. By instilling happiness into the sorrowful hearts of others, he will be blessed with the opportunity to eliminate unhappy circumstances in his own surroundings. Thus, the whole environment is improved.</p>
<p>Those who strive to make others happy will be rewarded by the very happiness they bring. Human relationships are mutual. As a famous saying states, “Happiness is a perfume you cannot pour on others without getting <strong>a few drops</strong> on yourself.” Heartfelt gratitude and <strong>compliments</strong> from those who have been helped will add to the person’s <strong>self esteem</strong> and happiness. Such a spiritual reward further <strong>assures</strong> his significant role in society. My teacher is a good example of this. She was capable of rendering much joy to her students in class. Her excellence in teaching has won our respect. We were all determined to achieve the best results in our studies and most of us succeeded in getting an admission to a university. Before we left school, she told us that she was the happiest person on earth.</p>
<p>To sum up, the way leading toward everlasting happiness <strong>is paved with</strong> endless efforts to make others happy. That is where the essence of happiness lies. As a consequence, each individual ought to appreciate the simple fact that it is impossible to feel happy if other people are suffering from unhappiness. With the purpose of filling the entire world with joy and happiness, all social members shoulder the responsibility to bring happiness to each other.</p>

<p>92．为了获得个人幸福，你必须使他人幸福？</p>
<p>通过实现自己的个人价值，人们会收获一种无法抗拒的幸福感。带给他人幸福的人在别人眼中是有价值的。的确，在人类世界中，宽广的人际网络造就了很多人与人之间的联系。任何人都无法孤立生存。因此，我们不能否认，获得个人幸福的基本条件之一就是使他人幸福。</p>
<p>首先，人们通过实现个人价值收获幸福。从心理角度来看，在帮助别人的过程中，强烈的成就感也会油然而生。不言而喻，没有人愿意被周围的人认定为无用之辈。如果一个人使他人幸福，他／她就证实了自我价值。的确，被认可为有用的社会成员充分证明了自己的个人价值。我们可以在“环球志愿者”身上获取实证。“环球志愿者”是一个旨在为需要的人提供免费教育与医疗援助的非营利组织。在一次采访中，某位志愿者表达出他在承担这项有意义的任务时收获的极大自豪感与幸福感。</p>
<p>此外，真正的幸福是与人分享的，而不是自我品尝的。很难想象当他人陷入深深的悲伤和绝望之中时一个人又怎么会感到幸福呢？在这种情况下，唯一的办法就是竭尽全力使他们重新振作起来。通过给他人悲伤的心灵注入幸福的源泉，人们便有机会消除自己周围的不幸福因素。于是，整个环境都得到了改善。</p>
<p>那些努力使他人幸福的人也会收获他人所给予的幸福。人们之间的关系是相互的。正如一句名言所述，“幸福如同香水，当你撒给别人的时候，自己身上也留有余香。”来自接受帮助者真挚的感激与赞美提升了一个人的自尊与幸福。这种精神上的奖励进一步证实了自己在社会中所起的重要作用。我的老师就是很好的榜样。她在课堂上能够给予学生很多快乐。她出色的教学也赢得了我们的尊重。于是，我们下定决心取得最好的学习成绩，最后，大多数同学都收到了大学录取通知书。在离校之前，她告诉我们她是世界上最幸福的人。</p>
<p>总而言之，在通往永久幸福的道路上，我们要尽全力使他人幸福。这就是幸福的精髓所在。因此，人人都应该理解一个简单的道理，那就是，如果他人不幸福，自己也不可能感到幸福。为了使整个世界充满快乐与幸福，所有社会成员都承担着相互给予幸福的责任。</p>

<h3><span id="93should-people-have-hobbies-and-do-physical-activities-different-from-their-work"> 93．Should people have hobbies and do physical activities different from their work?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>Inevitably, tiredness and boredom are the <strong>trials</strong> of the working class who live under heavy pressure today. Tight schedules deprive many people of the leisure time they deserve where they can rest and entertain themselves. Under such adverse circumstances, nobody could <strong>be blamed for</strong> feeling <strong>overwhelmed</strong>. To improve the situation and reduce the negative impact of overwork, it is absolutely imperative for people to have hobbies and do physical activities.</p>
<p>First of all, due to health concerns, picking up hobbies and taking part in physical activities are especially important. Physical exercise makes the human body stronger, and hobbies keep one in a good mental condition. Most working class people are leading <strong>tedious</strong> lives and are under a lot of stress. Throughout the week life is lived at a fast pace. A tight daily schedule definitely <strong>puts limits on</strong> living a relaxed and healthy lifestyle. Heavily burdened with endless tasks, most are facing potential health problems. As a consequence, immediate action ought to be taken to reduce the possibility of falling ill both mentally and physically. After work or during the weekend, spending some time on interesting hobbies sets a person’s mind free. For instance, planting flowers, enjoying personal collections, cooking delicious dishes, and drawing pictures, all these could inspire people into a relaxing state.</p>
<p>Secondly, working efficiency might be enhanced by a person’s restored energy due to hobbies and physical activities. Undoubtedly, a good mood <strong>holds the promise of</strong> a job well-done. Immersing oneself in a favorite hobby or activity <strong>for a while</strong> helps one recover from boredom and <strong>fatigue</strong>. The regained vigor can turn into motivation which will allow one to continue with their work effectively. Thus, as soon as one returns to the best physical and mental condition, he will be able to perform better in his job.</p>
<p>Moreover, everyone deserves an interesting and meaningful life. No matter how tedious the existing society may be, it is a basic human right for all people to enjoy leisure time by doing their favorite things. A reasonable balance ought to be maintained between work and play. Without a doubt, social progress owes much to the consistent energy and vigor of its citizens. If heavy work pressure deprives people of the qualities of an enjoyable life, the world would no longer develop in healthy and positive ways.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it would be <strong>unbearable</strong> for anyone to be confined in his work and not be able to engage in relaxing activities. Diversified hobbies and interesting activities contribute extensively to the <strong>enhancement</strong> of the quality of life. There is sufficient evidence to prove that all the time spent on these <strong>pursuits</strong> are <strong>rewarding</strong> in the long run.</p>

<p>93．人们应该拥有与自己工作截然不同的爱好或进行与自己工作截然不同的体育运动吗？</p>
<p>疲惫与烦躁不可避免地成为当今生活在重压之下的工薪阶层所遭受的磨难。紧凑的日程表夺走了很多人理应享有的休息和娱乐时光。在如此恶劣的条件下，没有人能够因为感觉痛苦而被指责。为了改善这种情况并减少过量工作带来的负面影响，人们绝对有必要培养自己的爱好并进行体育运动。</p>
<p>首先，出于健康原因，培养爱好和参加体育运动是极其重要的。体育锻炼使人们的身体更加强壮，而爱好使人保持良好的精神状态。大多数职员都在重压之下过着沉闷的生活。每周的生活都是快节奏的。如此紧凑的日程表必定与轻松健康的生活方式相悖。由于肩负着繁重的任务，大部分人都面临潜在的健康问题。因此，要立即采取行动降低患心理和生理疾病的风险。下班后或周末时花一些时间培养有趣的爱好能使人心情放松。例如，种花、欣赏个人收藏、烹制可口的饭菜和画画，所有这些都能使人轻松愉悦。</p>
<p>第二，由于爱好与体育运动使人精神焕发，工作效率也可能随之提高。毋庸置疑，良好的情绪预示着高质量的工作。片刻沉浸于爱好或运动之中能帮助人们赶走烦躁与疲惫。重新获得的活力将转化为动力，从而使他们继续高效率地工作。于是，一旦一个人回到了最佳的生理和心理状态，他／她就能在工作中有更好的表现。</p>
<p>此外，每个人都理应过上有趣且有意义的生活。无论当前的社会有多么浮躁，通过做自己喜欢的事享受闲暇时光是所有人的基本人权。劳逸之间应该保持合理的平衡。毫无疑问，社会进步在很大程度上归功于公民持续的能量与活力。如果沉重的工作压力剥夺了构成幸福生活的要素，那么，这个世界将不再健康积极地发展下去。</p>
<p>总之，任何人都难以承受被一直困在工作中而无法参与放松活动。多种多样的爱好和有趣的活动对提高生活质量起着巨大的作用。我们有充足理由证明，从长远来看，花时间做这些事是值得的。</p>

<p>Above all, the health of small children deserves to be the <strong>top priority</strong> in society. Advertisements targeted at this age group are mostly related to medicine, <strong>snacks</strong>, food and drinks as well as <strong>health care products</strong>. The consumers are not medical experts and therefore, it is hard for them to judge whether the information in those <strong>promotions</strong> is false or excessively exaggerated. Moreover, advertising is a major contributor to children’s unhealthy eating habits. Some of the most typical evidence can be found in fast food <strong>commercials</strong>. The appealing pictures of dishes make children addicted to the food which is high in sugar and fat. Consequently, in order to avoid being misled into buying harmful or <strong>futile</strong> products, we should advocate a ban on these advertisements.</p>
<p>The <strong>tempting messages</strong> in advertisements may lead to an unnecessary waste of money. The primary intention of most advertisements is a desire for financial gains. Advertisers are filling commercials with appealing visual effects so as to spark consumers’ desires to buy such targeted products. Faced with these overwhelming <strong>odds</strong>, there is no way for children to be fully protected from the <strong>onslaughts</strong>. In most cases, they would <strong>do their utmost</strong> <strong>to</strong> persuade their parents to buy their dream objects like expensive toys, snacks and drinks. Thus, much money is spent on superfluous merchandise, which is abandoned soon after being purchased. What’s worse, the world is full of <strong>indulgent</strong> parents who are willing to pay.</p>
<p>Advertisements targeting all young children should be banned. It is the government’s responsibility to reduce the harmful influences of advertisements on children to a large extent. Childhood is an important period when a person begins to adopt his values and form his concepts. Immature <strong>youngsters</strong> are lacking in essential abilities to distinguish between good and evil. Thus, they might be more easily misled by false ideas and messages included in the advertising. Sweden was the first country to ban all advertisements targeting children under 12 years old, which sets a powerful example for other nations around the world to follow.</p>
<p>In conclusion, under the powerful influence of the mass media, children as a special group of people, need to be well protected from the hidden hazards existing in advertising. It is imperative that parents along with the government join hands to eliminate anything that may negatively impact or harm children. Therefore, banning advertisements targeted at young children is totally <strong>justifiable</strong>.</p>

<p>94．应该禁止针对<strong><strong>2</strong></strong>到<strong><strong>5</strong></strong>岁儿童的广告吗？</p>
<p>由于广告业的争议性特质，与其相关的问题不断出现。广告明显的副作用在信息时代愈发严重了。为了抑制潜在的危害，有些人提议严厉禁止制作针对2到5岁儿童的广告。我赞同此建议。</p>
<p>首先，低龄儿童的健康值得社会的重点关注。针对此年龄阶段的广告大多与药品、零食、食品、饮料以及保健产品有关。消费者并非医学专家，因此，他们很难辨别促销广告信息是否虚假或被过分地夸大。此外，广告还是导致儿童不健康饮食习惯的主要因素之一。这一点可以在快餐食品的商业广告中得到证实。吸引人的菜品广告图使孩子们对那些高糖分、高脂肪的食物上瘾。因此，为了避免被误导购买有害的或无用的商品，我们应该提倡禁止此类广告。</p>
<p>广告中传递的诱人信息可能导致不必要的钱财浪费。大多数广告都是以获得盈利为初衷的。广告商在商业广告中加入了吸引人的视觉效果以激起消费者购买目标产品的欲望。面对这些难以抗拒的诱惑，孩子们很难完全免受影响。在大多数情况下，他们会尽力说服父母购买自己梦想得到的诸如昂贵玩具、零食和饮料之类的物品。于是，很多钱都花在了这些“奢侈品”上，而它们很快都会在购买后遭到“冷落”。更糟糕的是，这个世界到处都是溺爱孩子并愿意为他们花钱的家长。</p>
<p>针对所有儿童的广告都应该被禁止。政府有责任最大程度地减少广告对孩子的危害性影响。童年是一个人开始形成价值观和思想的关键时期。不成熟的少年缺乏辨别善恶的基本能力。于是，他们更容易遭受广告中包含的错误观念和信息的误导。瑞典是第一个禁止针对12岁以下儿童做广告的国家，这为全世界其他国家树立了强有力的榜样。</p>
<p>总之，在大众传媒强大的影响之下，作为特殊年龄群体的儿童应该免于遭受存在于广告中的潜在威胁。家长与政府应该携手共同消除影响或危害孩子们的消极因素。因此，禁止针对儿童的广告是完全无可非议的。</p>

<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>Successful people are those who never stop being open to new challenges. The <strong>risk-taking</strong> quality can be found in every <strong>notable</strong> individual. Instead of being obsessed with past glories, they all possess a far-reaching <strong>outlook</strong> about their future. <strong>Let bygones be bygones</strong>. The way ahead is <strong>brand new</strong> and <strong>unpredictable</strong>. <strong>Accordingly</strong>, only through continuous efforts and the courage to conquer more obstacles can success be <strong>held onto</strong> forever.</p>
<p>First and foremost, to ensure sustainable success, it is a must to continually accept new things. The whole world is in <strong>perpetual</strong> motion, thus, adapting to change is a fundamental requirement for anyone who dreams of <strong>brilliant</strong> accomplishments. If a person <strong>stagnates</strong> instead of moving ahead, he will certainly <strong>lag behind</strong> in his social development. We can find evidence of this in the sports arena. It is the ambition of many players to break a current record. However, after breaking the record, in order to <strong>keep up the pace</strong> one has to face more new challenges from others. Needless to say, only those who continue to make new <strong>breakthroughs</strong> are able to keep their success fresh and time-tested.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is no <strong>royal road</strong> to success. The willingness to take risks paves the way for people to reach the success <strong>summit</strong>. Chances only <strong>favor</strong> those who have prepared their minds. A life without risk is not worth living because that is where the true meaning of life lies. Indeed, life in itself is an adventure. The past is gone and is now only a cherished memory, whereas the future is always fresh and filled with endless <strong>revelations.</strong> Getting ready for any new changes or for taking a risk is the only way to gain bigger victories in the days to come. In fact, success is in the actual process of facing and overcoming challenges. In other words, if no risks are taken, there will be no gain. After all, Rome was not built in a day. The endeavor toward success is both <strong>time-consuming</strong> and painstaking.</p>
<p>Thirdly, it is unwise to feel overly proud and content with the past achievements. Looking back on my childhood, I can still recall a famous cartoon film, telling the story about a proud <strong>general</strong> during the war in ancient times. As the victor of a significant battle, he received extremely high prestige and numerous rewards. From then on, he began to indulge himself in thinking about his past glory and stopped practicing kongfu. He refused to study new <strong>warring strategies</strong> and as time went by, he became overweight and his former skills faded. Later new conflicts arose but this time his army was defeated by the stronger troops. Similar stories can be <strong>traced</strong> throughout human history.</p>
<p>In a sense, successful people are fearless pioneers with strong <strong>willpower</strong>. This allows them to assimilate new experiences and embrace change. Putting too much focus on “the good old days” can make a person lag behind in the fast pace of social development. Under no circumstances should a person give up their determination for meeting all the new challenges ahead. After all, success is neither easily gained nor easily kept.</p>

<p>95．轻车熟路还是勇于创新？</p>
<p>成功者是那些时刻迎接新挑战的人们。每位功名显赫之士都具备冒险的品质。他们都拥有对未来的远见，而不会沉迷于过去的辉煌。过去的都已经过去。前面的路是崭新的且无法预知的。因此，只有通过持续的努力以及克服更多困难的勇气才能将成功永远掌握在手中。</p>
<p>首先，为了确保成功的持久性，就必须不断接受新鲜事物。整个世界都处在持续运动中，因此，适应变化是对任何渴望取得光辉成就的人的基本要求之一。如果一个人停滞不前，他／她必定会在社会发展的潮流中落后。我们可以在体育界寻求证实。破纪录是很多运动员的梦想。然而，在打破一项纪录之后，为了将其保持下去，破纪录者必须应对来自他人更新的挑战。不必说，只有那些持续拥有新突破的人才能使自己的成功保鲜且经得住时间的考验。</p>
<p>其次，成功之路无坦途。冒险精神为人们抵达成功的顶峰铺路。机会只属于那些有准备的人。若没有冒险，人生就会虚度，因为那是生命真正的意义所在。的确，人生本身就是一次冒险。过去已经过去，对于现在而言过去仅仅是珍贵的记忆；而未来永远是崭新且充满无数未知的。为新变化或冒险作好准备是在未来获得更大成功的唯一途径。其实，成功就体现在面对与克服挑战的实际过程当中。也就是说，如果没有冒险，就没有收获。毕竟，罗马不是一日建成的。通往成功的拼搏之路是耗费时间且无比艰难的。</p>
<p>第三，为自己过去的成就感到过度骄傲与自满是不明智的。回首童年，我仍然记得一部著名动画片，它讲述了古代战争时期一名骄傲将军的故事。作为一次重要战役的胜利者，他获得了极高的荣誉和无数的奖赏。从那以后，他开始沉迷于自己过去的辉煌，停止了苦练功夫并拒绝学习先进的战术。随着时间的流逝，这位将军变得过于肥胖，曾经的一身武艺也随之消退。新的战争开始时，他的军队被强者击败了。在人类历史上，类似的故事举不胜举。</p>
<p>在某种意义上，成功者是拥有坚强意志的无畏先锋。这使他们能够吸收新经验并接受变化。过于注重“美好的过去”会使一个人落后于社会发展的飞快脚步。在任何情况下都不能放弃面对未来新挑战的决心。毕竟，成功既不易获得也不易保持。</p>

<h3><span id="96a-big-party-with-many-people-or-a-small-party-just-with-family"> 96．A big party with many people or a small party just with family?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>There are many important events in life that deserve to be celebrated. Whenever such special <strong>occasions</strong> arise, people will have a lot of plans to make. Holding a birthday or graduation party could be fun. Regarding the scale of these meaningful get-togethers, some people are in favor of organizing larger parties with many people being invited. Other people, however, would rather hold smaller ones within the family. I think it is a good idea to keep these personal events as simple as possible no matter how significant they may be.</p>
<p>In the first place, organizing a large party might be a waste of money and take too much energy. What’s more, it is <strong>exceptionally</strong> difficult to satisfy everyone. Before the party is held, the host has to address many detailed matters, including <strong>sending out</strong> invitations, selecting a large space, purchasing <strong>huge quantities of</strong> food, <strong>decorating</strong> the venue and preparing activities or performances. All these will definitely prove both expensive and time consuming. The situation could be challenging with many guests arriving. The host will need to entertain all of them <strong>whilst</strong> he is also <strong>in charge of</strong> the cooking, <strong>setting the table</strong> and all the other tasks. After the party the hard work continues as the host cleans up the <strong>mess</strong>.</p>
<p>In the second place, everyone ought to remain modest in his private life. It is absolutely unnecessary to have a large number of people join in these personal events. For most ordinary people, birthday celebrations and graduation parties are not social and commercial occasions which mostly aim at <strong>keeping up</strong> a celebrity’s public image. These special occasions ought to be spent in a simple manner. Inviting a crowd of people may give others the impression that the person <strong>attaches too much importance to</strong> himself. Those who overemphasize their importance in public might not be well accepted by the <strong>community</strong>.</p>
<p>Actually, major events in one’s life should be celebrated with the closest people, including the family and intimate friends. Indeed, this memorable time is destined to be <strong>carefree</strong> and comfortable, without interference from others. On birthdays or graduation days, the sincere wishes from loved ones are the most precious gifts one could receive. Having a delicious meal together and chatting freely are simple things to do, but they can bring great happiness and memories that will be cherished forever.</p>
<p>In my opinion, there is definitely no need to <strong>take the trouble to</strong> organize a big party to celebrate such events as birthdays or a graduation. These memorable moments should be shared with loved ones instead of <strong>going public</strong>. Although it might seem like a good idea to have a large number of guests, a simple party is usually a better choice for most ordinary people.</p>

<p>96．举办很多人参加的大型聚会还是只有家人参加的小型聚会？</p>
<p>一生中有不少值得庆祝的重要事件。每当此类特殊场合来临时，人们会制定出很多计划。举办生日或毕业派对是很有趣的。对于这些有意义的聚会的规模（人们有不同看法），有些人喜欢组织多人参加的大型派对，而有的人则更偏向举行小型家庭聚会。我认为，无论这些个人事件有多么重要，聚会应该越简单越好。</p>
<p>第一，组织大型派对会浪费过多的钱财与精力，而且众口难调。在聚会开始之前，主人需要处理很多琐事，包括发送邀请函、选择宽阔场地、购买大量食材、装饰场地以及准备活动与节目。所有这些必定要付出昂贵的代价，而且很耗费时间。宾客抵达的时候，情况会更加棘手。主人需要招待所有人，并同时负责烹饪、摆餐桌等。派对结束后，还得继续辛苦地做清理工作。</p>
<p>第二，每个人都应该对自己的私生活保持低调。完全没有必要让一大群人参与到这些私事之中。对于大多数普通百姓来说，生日庆祝和毕业派对并非旨在维系名人公众形象的社交和商业场合。这些特殊场合应该注重简约。邀请很多客人还会让人感觉主人过于自大。过分强调公众形象的人不易被自己的群体所接受。</p>
<p>其实，人生大事应该与最亲近的人一起庆祝，包括家人和密友。的确，具有纪念意义的时刻理应是无拘无束、舒适且无他人干扰的。在生日或毕业时，来自亲人的真诚祝福是个人收到的最珍贵的礼物。与他们一起共进美餐并自由地交谈，这些虽然看起来很平凡，却能带来值得永久珍惜的巨大幸福与美好回忆。</p>
<p>在我看来，为诸如生日或毕业之类的事情费工夫组织大型聚会庆祝的确毫无必要。这些有纪念意义的时刻应该与亲人共度，而不应过于公开化。尽管让很多宾客到来看起来是个不错的主意，但对于大多数普通人来说，举行简单的聚会通常是更佳选择。</p>

<h3><span id="97to-remain-happy-and-optimistic-when-you-fail-is-more-important-than-success"> 97．To remain happy and optimistic when you fail is more important than success?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>Perhaps everyone is familiar with the frequently-quoted proverb “Failure is the mother of success.” Without a doubt, the way to success is paved with endless challenges and it is inevitable that one may fail at some point. Thus, it is critical to maintain a positive <strong>state of mind</strong> in these circumstances. Indeed, the quality of remaining happy and <strong>optimistic</strong> when failure <strong>looms</strong> is more important than success itself.</p>
<p>First of all, those who attach too much importance to success are more likely to <strong>feel disappointment</strong> when they face failure. In most cases, having high expectations means taking greater risks. If one sets his aim overly high, the chances for experiencing failure are increased. Moreover, the desire to win <strong>at any cost</strong> often makes a person <strong>overbearing</strong> and unreasonably <strong>demanding</strong>. <strong>Minor setbacks</strong> might cause a loss of confidence, or even produce overwhelming <strong>distress</strong>. Therefore I think it is unrealistic to expect a person who is down in spirit to accomplish their goals.</p>
<p>Secondly, being optimistic under all conditions is of great importance in a person’s life. This admirable characteristic not only <strong>enables him to</strong> endure hardships and difficulties but also affects other people positively, inspiring in them the courage to move on <strong>in the wake of</strong> failures. We may compare life to a <strong>voyage</strong> on the ocean. The sailors must prepare for the possibility of danger and <strong>ride the waves as best they can</strong> to <strong>triumph over</strong> storms, <strong>icebergs</strong>, and even <strong>pirates</strong>. When danger does show up, optimism is the navigator that leads them ever onwards toward their destination.</p>
<p>To some extent, if a person never <strong>surrenders to</strong> the <strong>misfortunes</strong>, he may succeed in winning admiration and respect from people. In this way, it could be said that one’s success is held firmly in the palm of his own hands and that other people’s acknowledgements are reliable signs that his future will be successful. Just as the famous saying goes, “<strong>The outsider sees more clearly</strong>.” One’s optimism in the face of temporary loss is sure to touch the hearts of others.</p>
<p>The outcome is less important than the process and all obstacles and failures faced on the journey towards success are extremely valuable. The skills that are used for remaining optimistic and enthusiastic in the face of failure stay with a person for their entire lifetime. In most cases, success is not the absolute and permanent possession of anyone. As with the constant changes in time and space, success in life has an <strong>ebb and flow</strong>. These time-tested skills to stay positive are worthy of being cherished as the most <strong>prized</strong> spiritual treasures.</p>
<p>Consequently, for each ambitious individual who strives to accomplish tremendous success, it is imperative to train oneself to be optimistic and be fully prepared for any kind of disappointments that may present at any time. Being overly obsessed with success can bring disappointments in the long run. Only by owning his power and remaining happy much of the time can one lead a successful and meaningful life.</p>

<p>97．在失败时保持乐观比成功本身更重要？</p>
<p>也许所有人都很熟悉“失败乃成功之母”这句被屡次引用的名言。毫无疑问，成功之路充满了无尽的挑战，一个人难免会在某处经历失败。因此，在这些情况下，务必要保持积极向上的心态。的确，在失败时能够保持乐观态度的品质比成功本身更重要。</p>
<p>首先，太注重成功的人更有可能在面临失败的时候感到失望。在大多数情况下，期望高意味着承担更大的风险。如果一个人制定过高的目标，经历失败的几率也会增加。此外，不惜一切代价渴望取胜通常会使人变得傲慢与极端苛刻。微小的失误可能使其丧失信心，甚至产生难以抗拒的抑郁。因此，我们指望精神低迷的人达到自己的目标是不现实的。</p>
<p>第二，在各种情况下都保持乐观对人的一生是非常重要的。这种理想的品质不仅使人承受艰难困苦，还能积极地影响其他人，激起他们失败之后继续前进的勇气。我们可以把人生比作大海上的一次航行。水手们必须为可能出现的危险作好准备，并竭尽全力乘风破浪以战胜暴风雨、冰山、甚至海盗。当危险真正来临的时候，乐观精神就是指引他们继续向目的地行进的领航员。</p>
<p>在某种程度上，如果一个人在面对不幸的时候永不妥协，他／她就可能会赢得人们的崇拜与尊敬。鉴于此，一个人的成功是被牢牢掌握在自己手中的，同时，他人的认可则是预示他／她未来成功的可靠信号。正如这句名言所述，“旁观者清。”一个人在暂时的失败面前所持有的乐观态度必定会触动他人的心弦。</p>
<p>过程比结果更重要，在向成功奋进的途中所遭遇的困难与失败是极其珍贵的。在失败面前保持乐观与热情的本领可伴随人的整个一生。在大多数情况下，成功不是能被人们绝对掌控的永久经历。因为随着时空的持续转变，人生中的成功也会起起伏伏。而保持乐观的本领却经受得住时间的考验，并值得被视作最珍贵的精神财富。</p>
<p>因此，对于每个有志取得巨大成功的人，训练自己的乐观本领并随时为可能出现的各种失望作好充分准备都是十分必要的。从长远来看，过度沉迷于成功会导致失望。只有始终保持活力与乐观才能活得成功且有意义。</p>

<h3><span id="98should-university-students-in-all-fields-be-required-to-take-history-courses"> 98．Should university students in all fields be required to take history courses?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>Being the cradles of knowledge, universities play an extremely important role in society. The overall knowledge and awareness level of citizens depends considerably on the quality of the teachers in the institutions of higher learning. With the aim of taking education to a brand new level, some people argue that college students should be required to take history classes no matter in what field they study. In my opinion, this idea <strong>is</strong> truly <strong>worthy of</strong> consideration.</p>
<p>Under no circumstances should history be forgotten. Marcus Cicera, a notable Roman <strong>politician</strong>, described history as “the witness of times, the torch of truth, the life of memory, the teacher of life and the messenger of <strong>antiquity</strong>”. Indeed, these titles were not given <strong>groundlessly</strong>, but rather present the essence of history in a wise man’s eyes. People who never <strong>look back into</strong> the past may not be able to move forward into a prosperous future. No matter which profession a person has, no matter how high one’s social position, it is a must for him to know the history and etch it deeply into his mind. All historic events hold <strong>immense</strong> knowledge, ideas and values. To <strong>be</strong> <strong>ignorant of</strong> history is to cause one to lag behind at a slow pace. History can also make one more fully <strong>appreciative</strong> <strong>of</strong> the present. To illustrate, learning about the <strong>sacrifices</strong> men made on the battlefields, people may appreciate how priceless today’s peace and happiness are.</p>
<p>Concerning science, taking history classes can help students in a number of ways. In fact, history often <strong>repeats itself</strong>. Learning about past mistakes one’s ancestors made cautions people to not make the same mistakes again. This is especially critical for a science student. Having done a thorough study of the history of science, learning about the numerous mistakes the scientists made and the experiences gained from them, students become more conscious about their own future endeavors. Besides, learning the stories of past scientists and their achievements can also <strong>inspire</strong> one to strive for much greater personal accomplishments.</p>
<p>Regarding students who major in <strong>liberal arts</strong>, learning history is also necessary. In a sense, history is an excellent <strong>indicator</strong> of the future. For instance, learning about the history of law, law students would begin to realize the importance of developing a fairer and more effective law system in the days to come. Meanwhile, language students probing into the lives of ancient writers and their works can enrich their minds and further comprehend modern literature. Also, learning about the history of different countries can benefit those who major in foreign languages and cultures.</p>
<p>In conclusion, to prepare <strong>adolescents</strong> for a brighter future, education authorities ought to adopt innovative measures to improve the teaching quality. Included in these proposals, is perhaps to require students to take history classes. This could be a rewarding experience for them. Whatever academic subjects students are focused on, learning more about their past will help ensure a more promising future.</p>

<p>98．应该要求所有专业的大学生都选修历史课吗？</p>
<p>作为知识的摇篮，大学在社会中扮演着极其重要的角色。公民整体的知识与意识水平在很大程度上取决于高等院校里的教师素质。为了将教育提升到一个崭新的高度，有些人提议要求所有专业的学生都选修历史课。在我看来，这个想法确实值得考虑。</p>
<p>在任何情况下都不应忘却历史。罗马政治家马库斯·西塞罗将历史描述为“时代的见证，事实的火炬，回忆的人生，生命的导师以及古人的信使”。的确，这些头衔都不是无缘无故地给予的，它们展现了在智者眼中历史的精髓所在。不愿回顾过去的人也可能无法走向蓬勃的未来。无论一个人从事什么行业，无论其社会地位有多高，都必须了解历史并将其铭刻于心。所有历史事件都包含着很多知识、理念与价值观。忽视历史会导致一个人落后于时代的脚步。历史还使人更加理解现在。例如，了解到过去战争中的牺牲，人们会懂得当今的和平与幸福有多么珍贵。</p>
<p>在科学领域，学习历史课在很多方面可以帮助学生。其实，历史本身通常是反复的。掌握前人所犯的错误使人们提高避免犯相同错误的意识。这对于一个理科学生尤为重要。通过对科学史的深入钻研，学生学习到无数科学家曾经犯过的错误以及从这些错误中汲取的经验教训，于是，他们会在未来的学习过程中加强自我意识。此外，了解过去科学家的轶事以及他们的成果还会鼓舞学生为更大的个人成就而努力奋斗。</p>
<p>对于文科专业的学生，学习历史同样有必要。在某种意义上，历史是未来的优秀指引者。比如，在研究了法律史之后，法律专业的学生会开始意识到在未来建立更公正、更有效的法律体系有多么重要。同时，通过深入了解古代作家的生活及其作品，语言专业的学生能够丰富自己的思想并更进一步理解现代文学。此外，学习不同国家的历史也会使那些以外国语言文化为专业的学生受益。</p>
<p>总而言之，为了使青少年拥有更光明的前途，校方应该采取革新的措施改善教学质量。要求学生学习历史课也许就包含在这些措施之中。这对于他们而言是值得的。无论学生专攻哪个学术领域，了解更多的过去有助于确保更美好的未来。</p>

<p>Throughout one’s lifetime, many important decisions have to be made. They are all critical to determine a person’s future. Some choices might <strong>bring about unfavorable</strong> consequences. With the aim of getting the best results, what is needed is <strong>thoughtful</strong> consideration and objective <strong>reasoning</strong> regarding important issues. I believe it is sometimes beyond one’s individual power to make the correct decisions alone and so it is a good idea to include others in this process.</p>
<p>To begin with, parents could be helpful in the decision-making process. Having witnessed each step of their child’s growth, parents are the best people qualified to help their children make better decisions. The younger generation is wise to take advantage of their <strong>elders’</strong> rich life experiences and mature mentality. Parents are often more capable of understanding how to settle uncertainties than their children. Meanwhile, they are also those most familiar with their children, thus knowing their strong points and shortcomings well. These are all elements that must be thought about before making a choice. For instance, before a person <strong>makes a final decision to</strong> get married, they could turn to their parents for wisdom and support. Just as a popular saying expresses, &quot;Marriage without an agreement from the parents can never have a happy ending.”</p>
<p>Teachers also <strong>play a key role in</strong> guiding their students to make important decisions. Among these choices, a large number might be associated with work and study. At the <strong>crossroads</strong> of a decision, it is the beloved teacher that students should <strong>humbly consult with</strong>. Either before leaving school or after entering the workforce, they are more than willing to offer effective guidelines or suggestions. For example, when it is the time to decide on future majors at the university, teachers are able to help. Teachers are aware of the individual conditions of each student and can draw up <strong>constructive</strong> plans for them to refer to. If a student has demonstrated his excellence in science at school, he may be advised to choose related fields of study and appropriate institutions which best fit his <strong>specialty</strong>. Thus, <strong>the likelihood of</strong> being admitted to a satisfactory university is considerably increased.</p>
<p>Intimate friends also constitute another reliable group of people who can offer good advice. Indeed, no one can deny the power of friendship, especially <strong>in times of need</strong>. True friends always <strong>stand by our side</strong> and give honest <strong>appraisals</strong>. In most cases, their suggestions work very well, because friends often look at the world from a similar perspective. Thus, they are likely to come up with some agreeable ideas.</p>
<p>When the moment of decision-making arrives, one should always bear in mind that he is not alone. Sources of support and guidance are available for him to turn to. Those who are more familiar with his character often come up with the most useful ideas. As the saying goes, &quot;<strong>Two heads are better than one</strong>.”</p>

<p>99．人们应该独自作出重要决定吗？</p>
<p>在人的一生中要作出很多重要的决定，它们对未来起着关键的作用。有些选择也许会招致不良后果。为了获得最理想的结果，人们需要对重要问题进行周全的考虑和客观的推理。我认为，仅仅依靠个人力量有时是无法作出正确决定的，最好将他人也融入到作决定的过程之中。</p>
<p>首先，父母在作决定时是可以给予帮助的。由于目睹了自己孩子每一步的成长历程，家长最有资格帮助孩子作出更好的决定。年轻一代利用长辈丰富的生活经验和成熟的心理是很明智的。父母通常比孩子更加懂得如何处理困惑。与此同时，他们也是最熟悉自己的孩子的，因此他们明白孩子的优点和缺点在哪里。这些都是作决定之前必须顾及的因素。例如，在一个人最终决定结婚之前，理应向父母寻求意见与支持。正如一句俗语所云，“得不到父母赞同的婚姻是不会幸福的。”</p>
<p>作重要决定时老师也起着重要的引导作用。在这些选择中，很多都可能与工作和学习有关。每当站在某决定的分岔路口上，学生应该虚心请教的是他们敬爱的老师。无论在离开学校之前还是在工作之后，老师都十分愿意给予最有效的指导或建议。例如，当大学生选择专业时，老师就可以给予帮助。由于老师了解每个学生的个人情况，因此他们可以为学生量身定制建设性的计划供他们参考。如果一个学生在科学方面表现出色，老师也许会建议他／她选择相关的专业以及最适合其特长的大学。于是，这个学生被理想的大学录取的可能性就大大增加了。</p>
<p>知心朋友也是可以提供良好建议的另一个可靠群体。的确，没有人能否认友谊的力量，尤其是在艰难时刻。真正的朋友总是陪在我们身边并给予我们诚恳的评价。在大多数情况下，他们的建议会起作用，那是因为好朋友通常从相似的视角观察世界。因此，他们有可能产生一些适宜的想法。</p>
<p>当一个人作决定的时候，应该始终牢记：自己并不是孤单的。他／她可以寻求到很多支持与指导。那些更熟悉他／她性格的人们通常会给予最有用的想法。常言说得好，“三个臭皮匠赛过诸葛亮。”</p>

<h3><span id="100is-the-ability-to-cooperate-well-with-others-more-important-today-than-it-was-in-the-past"> 100．Is the ability to cooperate well with others more important today than it was in the past?</span></h3>
<h4><span id="范文"> 范文</span></h4>
<p>As social animals, human beings value teamwork. Indeed, no one could survive and prosper without the help and support of others. It is cooperation between people that <strong>allows for</strong> smooth progress within a society in every historical period. Thus, whether in the past or today, the ability to cooperate well with others is always important.</p>
<p>In times of war, working well with others was critical to everyone’s survival and <strong>livelihood</strong>. Throughout Chinese history, the changing dynasties are a typical feature of social advancement, even though endless battles and wars were taking place. Most ordinary citizens had to join in these struggles against enemies so that they could survive and <strong>eventually</strong> live in peace. Therefore, it <strong>makes sense</strong> for soldiers and citizens alike to unite as one. True victories are only for the troops whose members were capable of cooperating well with one another, both in war strategies and <strong>military tactics</strong>. Also, generals with superior <strong>leadership</strong> skills could inspire the troops’ morale. They all understood that unity is <strong>a matter of life and death</strong>. Without good teamwork, the troops would <strong>collapse</strong> and by no means survive, let alone win battles.</p>
<p>In modern times, excellent teamwork can lead to <strong>common wealth</strong>. In the past, with an undeveloped economy, the majority of people were living in poverty. With a common aim of achieving prosperity, workers, farmers, businessmen, teachers and people of other professions have joined in the endeavor towards social and economic progress. It has been essential for everyone to combine their efforts for an enhanced standard of living. The development of a nation <strong>is closely linked with</strong> its people’s general interests. Now our parents can still recall the high spirits of workers in most factories. The value of “<strong>unity is power</strong>” <strong>was</strong> deeply <strong>rooted in their minds</strong>. <strong>Brotherly</strong> cooperation between colleagues was important for the realization of their shared dream.</p>
<p>At present, in order to achieve success in such a competitive society, people from all walks of life are also required to value teamwork. Without a doubt, no one is strong enough to face the overwhelming challenges of competitors by relying solely on his own strength. Thus, in any organization, each individual is obliged to cooperate with his co-workers without exception. Those who lack such essential skills are certain to <strong>be weeded out</strong> of the team. In fact, so long as social construction continues, cooperation is always needed.</p>
<p>To summarize, human history has witnessed the <strong>unmistakable</strong> significance of teamwork. The ability to cooperate well with others not only benefits the individual, but also helps to ensure that the entire social development thrives. Despite the remarkable changes taking place nowadays, this opinion has remained the same. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that such an ability in an individual is equally important at all times.</p>

<p>100．如今，与他人良好合作的能力比过去更重要了吗？</p>
<p>作为社会动物的人类很重视团队协作。的确，离开了他人的帮助与支持，没有人能够生存与发展。正是人与人之间的合作使得社会在每个历史阶段平稳发展。因此，无论是在过去还是在现在，与他人良好合作的能力始终都很重要。</p>
<p>在战争时期，与他人并肩作战对每个人的生存与生计都是至关重要的。纵观中国历史，尽管发生过无数次战役与战争，朝代的更替是社会进步的主要标志。为了生存下去并最终获得和平，大多数老百姓不得不加入到抵抗敌军的队伍之中。因此，士兵与百姓的团结一致很有意义。只有那些成员们在战略与战术上都紧密合作的军队才能取得真正的胜利。此外，拥有超强领导才能的将军可以鼓舞军队的士气。他们都懂得团结与否事关生死。没有良好的团队协作，军队就会瓦解乃至灭亡，更不用说打胜仗了。</p>
<p>在现代，优秀的团队协作可以造就共同财富。过去，由于经济落后，大多数人都生活在贫困之中。为了实现共同繁荣的目标，工人、农民、商人、教师以及其他各行各业的人们携起手来为社会经济发展而奋斗。每个人都必须与他人共同努力以提高生活水平。国家的发展与国民的整体利益息息相关。至今我们的父母还能回忆起当时大多数工厂里工人高涨的工作热情。“团结就是力量”的观念深入人心。同事间兄弟般的合作对于实现共同理想至关重要。</p>
<p>在当代，为了在竞争激烈的社会中取得成功，各行各业的人们也应该重视团队协作。毋庸置疑，仅仅依靠自己一个人的微薄之力很难应对竞争对手艰难的挑战。因此，在所有组织机构中，每个成员都有义务与同事合作，且无一例外。那些缺乏基本合作能力的人势必将遭到团队的淘汰。其实，只要社会建设持续进行，合作就不可或缺。</p>
<p>总之，人类历史已经见证了团队协作的显著意义。与他人良好合作的能力不仅造福于个人，而且还有助于确保整个社会的繁荣发展。尽管如今发生了很多惊人的变化，此观念却始终依旧。因此，我们有理由相信，这种个人能力在所有时代都同等重要。</p>
